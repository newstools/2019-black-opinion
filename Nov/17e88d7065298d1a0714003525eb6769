Photo credit: Reuters By BO Staff writer Voting for the second round of the 2020 elections was officially conducted yesterday in Uruguay from 8:00 to 19:30 Daniel Martínez, the candidate of the leftist Frente Amplio party, obtained 39.02 % of the vote during the first round of the presidential elections. Following the first round of voting, where Martínez failed to reach the 50 % required to be elected as President, the second round of elections, was triggered. The right-wing candidate Luis Lacalle Pou has a five % lead over Martínez, according to a Consulting Teams survey conducted recently. There are accordingly legitimate fears for the election of a right-wing president in Uruguay. In the meantime the interim results from the second round are too close to announce the winner before Thursday or maybe even Friday, Uruguay’s Electoral Court announced on Sunday night. As things stood by last night, 97.7 % of votes were counted, Lacalle obtained 48.8 % and Martinez 47.4 % of the vote.The U.S. backed Lacalle leads by a small margin. The left-wing Broad Front has obtained victory in the last three presidential elections and Uruguay under its rule has been proven to be a promising model of a responsive state. It has brought significant radical transformation of the economy and education. It has moreover reduced the unemployment, poverty and extreme poverty rates markedly in the past 15 years.
