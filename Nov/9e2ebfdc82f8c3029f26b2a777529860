By Andile Mngxitama Dear black people, Black First Land First (BLF) doesn’t belong to Andile Mngxitama or Zanele Zan Lwana. It’s not our personal property. We are just leaders with others who share the same vision and sacrifices with us to push the black agenda. BLF belongs to ALL black people, including those who hate it and its leaders. Never ask, “when are you bringing BLF to our area”. YOU are BLF in so long as you are black. You may however ask for direction to build BLF. We can help, but it’s your thing. Build it. Defend it. Whites have their Democratic Alliance, Freedom Front Plus, Afrikaner-bond, AWB, Orania and Afriforum, amongst others. Blacks have BLF. I thank you. Andile Mngxitama is the President of BLF, a radical black consciousness organization. No related posts.
