By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published on the Black First Land First website: Today the High Court in Pietermaritzburg will deliver its judgment in the application brought by President Zuma for a permanent stay of prosecution. They will deny him the relief he seeks. In other words, he will lose. Also, judgment will be delivered today in the Johannesburg High Court on the complaint lodged by the rightwing Solidarity against Black First Land First (BLF). Just like in the Zuma case, we too are going lose. We are under judicial attack to protect the Stellenbosch mafia and its ThumaMina brigade. Aluta!!!
