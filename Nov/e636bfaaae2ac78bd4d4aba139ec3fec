Photo credit: Caitlin Johnstone By BO Staff Writer Evo Morales was removed from power in Bolivia by a rightwing coup last Sunday and replaced by a U.S. backed dictatorship led in the interim by Jeanine Anez. Prior to the coup, leftist countries such as Venezuela and Cuba were strategic allies of Bolivia. The puppet dictatorship is now cutting its ties with these nations and aligning itself with the foreign policy of the U.S. Karen Longaric, Bolivia’s interim Foreign Minister, announced on Friday that about 725 Cubans, including doctors and other medical staff, will be expelled from the country. She further said that all diplomats working at the Venezuelan embassy in La Paz will be expelled for allegedly interfering in the internal affairs of the state. Reportedly, when asked if Bolivia would maintain its ties with Venezuelan President Maduro, she responded, “Of course we’ll break diplomatic relations with the Maduro government,” In the meanwhile Morales’s loyalists, who constitute the majority in both houses of congress, don’t recognize Anez’s unelected government. They say it lacks the authority to make any policy decision and recognize only Morales as President. No related posts.
