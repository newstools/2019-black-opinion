Image credit: sanef By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published on the Black First Land First website: Black First Land First (BLF) calls on the South African National Editors’ Forum (SANEF) to stop with immediate effect its plans to protect Minister Gwede Mantashe and thereby promote criminality and corruption. The media must not try to make a gentlemen’s deal with Gwede to make his self-confessed crimes go away. SANEF has unethically met with Gwede and is trying to make his problems go away with a mere apology. This is an insult. SANEF can’t investigate itself and then determine remedies. A criminal case of corruption and bribery has been opened against Mantashe yesterday by BLF. We call on SANEF to cooperate with the police and stop its white washing shenanigans.
