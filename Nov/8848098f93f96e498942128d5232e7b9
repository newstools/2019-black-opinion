Just for this reason she begins to look Presidential. Remember whatever the enemy opposes we support, whatever it supports we oppose. It therefore makes sense that we support Sisulu. We got this on good authority! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization. No related posts.
