Image credit: SAHO By Andile Mngxitams Black people in South Africa (SA) formed the South African Native National Congress (SANNC) in 1912. It was for blacks only. The whites who claim to be communist infiltrated the SANNC. By 1955 the SANNC was taking instructions from whites who in turn wrote the Freedom Charter for the organization. The Freedom ICharter says SA belongs to the land thieves. On Saturday at the Special Policy Conference of Black First Land First (BLF) in Durban, more specifically in the Presidential address, we shall reflect on this and why the white system is so worried about our movement. We shall not betray the founders of the African National Congress (ANC). We know the consequences of white controlâ€¦ #UnBanBLF Andile Mngxitama is the President of the radical black consciousness organization, Black First Land First (BLF). No related posts.
