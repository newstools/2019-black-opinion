By Andile Mngxitama Bafana Bafana represents the landless and the defeated. They have no country. They play like a colonised people who have given up on the struggle. The Springboks, on the other hand, represent land thieves. They play to hold on to the stolen territory. Black players in the Springboks are just good rugby players who are like mercenaries. Get the difference? Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization. No related posts.
