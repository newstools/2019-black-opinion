By Andile Mngxitama People should not have sex in the office, more so politicians than ordinary people. But that can’t be a good enough reason to fire people. If the sex is consensual, if there’s no claim of sexual harassment or force, why fire them for having office sex. We are a highly sexualised society. In fact, we are a promiscuous lot. Fire them for being members of the racist Democratic Alliance (DA). Yes, these people should be fired for being DA, not for having sex at work. Vilify them for serving racism, not for sex at the office. Just saying… We must not be like the USA where politicians get impeached for blowjobs but celebrated for bombing children and innocent people.
