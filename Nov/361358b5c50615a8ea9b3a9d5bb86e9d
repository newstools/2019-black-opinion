By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published on the Black First Land First website: The judgment in the Equality Court case of Solidarity & Bereaved Families versus BLF & 2 others which was scheduled to be delivered at 12noon today was telephonically postponed to 3 December 2019. The matter relates to allegations of hate speech concerning the response of Black First Land First (BLF) to the Driehoek Primary School tragedy. Virtually two hours before judgment was due to be handed down, the President of BLF, Andile Mngxitama, got a call from the South Gauteng High Court (where the Equality Court sits in this case) informing him that the matter was postponed to next Tuesday, December 3rd. He was called in his capacity as the representative of the respondents This seems abnormal. It must be unprecedented that a judge has decided two hours before delivering his judgment that the matter must instead be postponed, and that the respondents must be called in this regard. The judiciary practically kept BLF busy a day before our Special Policy Conference and then said, “no judgement today“. This morning President Zuma’s application for stay of prosecution was denied. The judiciary didn’t want to make it too obvious that it is dealing with BLF and Zuma in the same day. We also hope there were no calls from Stellenbosch. We really hope so. We know that BLF is being persecuted by Stellenbosch. And stuff like this makes us wonder. Not that we expected a judgement in our favor. Never!
