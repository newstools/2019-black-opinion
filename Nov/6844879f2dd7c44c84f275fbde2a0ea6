Photo credit: nodal By BO Staff Writer The ex chancellor of Ecuador and ex president of the UN General Assembly, María Fernanda Espinosa, will contest the position of secretary general (SG) of the Organization of American States (OAS) with Luis Almagro, the incumbent SG – according to Ronald Sanders, the ambassador of Antigua and Barbuda. Sanders has reportedly said that Antigua and Barbuda as well as numerous other states have decided to support Espinosa‘s appointment in this regard. He however declined to disclose which countries supported the decision. “Right now I prefer not to speak for them,” he explained. Almagro has historically, since his election as SG in March 2015, caused division in the organization in favor of US imperialist interests and against the good of the Latin American and Caribbean region. The OAS comprises of 35 members, one of which is Cuba which doesn’t participate. The expiry date to field candidates for the position is December 15 and the voting will be conducted in March 2020. The vote will be determined by a simple majority of 18. Sanders suggested that Almagro has not been doing his job as the SG which is to develop consensus among the member states so as to enable the organization to speak with a singular voice. He intimated that Espinosa, who has UN experience and the interests of the region at heart, will better serve as SG of the OAS. No related posts.
