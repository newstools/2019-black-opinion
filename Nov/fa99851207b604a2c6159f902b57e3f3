By Andile Mngxitama As we go to the Black First Land First (BLF) Special Policy Conference, I ask myself: How are we going to help our people understand that there is a conspiracy against them to keep them locked out? How do we educate and organize for black liberation?
How do we make sure our people are ready for their own thing and they can defend it? Them white folk’s organizations aren’t fronts for black interests, like all our important organizations are. You vote for the African National Congress (ANC), you vote for Stellenbosch. You vote for the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), you vote for Stellenbosch. You vote for the Democratic Alliance (DA), you vote for Stellenbosch. Where is our thing? How do we build our thing? How do we make black people understand that we are in the middle of a war? Today we go to court. Yes again! Solidarity the labour wing of white interests took us to court and they will win today. A black judge is going to rule against us. It’s all a set up! We are going to Durban tomorrow to do our own thing. Have you helped with a donation? Are you coming to make a contribution to BLF’s Special Policy Conference? Did you send an email to help guide us? Who must build this black thing if not you? Good morning black people. No! Black Friday ain’t your thing, just like your organisations and leaders ain’t your thing… #UnBanBLF Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
