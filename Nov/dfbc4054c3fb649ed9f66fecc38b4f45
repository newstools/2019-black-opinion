By Andile Mngxitama Today, 26 November, #BLF26 will be in the Magistrateâ€™s court in Pretoria (Tshwane) facing charges of contravening apartheid legislation. The Cyril Ramaphosa administration is using racist laws to defend apartheid grand corruption. 26 Black First Land First (BLF) leaders were arrested in July 2016 for demanding that the former Public Protector, Thuli Madonsela, investigates the R26 billion stolen from the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) by the likes of ABSA and Johann Rupert; and state capture by white monopoly capital. After two years of senseless dragging of the #BLF26 through the court process, the matter was thrown out for lack of evidence. The Ramaphosa administration has now concocted new charges on the same incident. Stellenbosch and London are coming after all the radical economic transformation (RET) forces. They are using the state to silence us whilst protecting the whites like Markus Jooste. Where is Jooste? The judiciary is a weapon of white monopoly capital. #UnBanBLF Andile Mngxitama is the President of the radical black consciousness organization, Black First Land First (BLF). No related posts.
