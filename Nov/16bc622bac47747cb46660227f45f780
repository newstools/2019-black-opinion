By Andile Mngxitama President Zuma is in court today. The presiding bench will hear his case and then find against him. This is not law. It’s the anti black judiciary doing its part to finish off anything associated with Radical Economic Transformation (RET). It’s fair to say, RET lost in the Nasrec elective conference of the African National Congress (ANC). It was beaten by Stellenbosch and London that spent R1 billion to buy a President for South Africa that they can control. The ANC is a weapon against the people right now. Can the people stand up and reclaim the ANC? Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization. No related posts.
