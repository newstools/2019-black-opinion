Photo credit: citizen By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published on the Black First Land First website: Black First Land First (BLF) says happy birthday to the Secretary General of the African National Congress (ANC). Our movement recognizes Comrade Ace as one of the key proponents of Radical Economic Transformation (RET). This explains the relentless slander perpetuated against him by the White Monopoly Capital (WMC) owned and controlled media. As BLF we recognize that WMC is the primary enemy and therefore all those who come under its attack are, by that fact alone, our comrades. Comrade Ace has actively taken a stand for RET and WMC has systematically responded in protection of its own interests. BLF opposes whatever the enemy supports and supports whatever the enemy opposes. On our part we wish Cde Ace many more years. We also commit to labour for the realisation of RET as a minimum program to unite all the progressive peoples and organizations in a non partisan way. Principled unity in action, based on a minimum program, shall help advance the course of real transformation. As we celebrate the birthday of Cde Ace, we wish for a complete defeat and destruction of the Stellenbosch inspired so called ‘New Dawn’ which is a program to surrender the country to the enemy. Happy birthday Comrade SG! Land or Death! Issued by Black First Land First, National Coordinating Committee of (BLF NCC)
