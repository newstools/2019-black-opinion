Photo credit: Drum By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published on the Black First Land First website: “Mr President, my people are poor and hungry; they have no jobs, no security, no proper education. They are unemployed and depend on social grants” – King Sigcawu to President Zuma King Mpendulo Zwelonke Sigcawu of AmaXhosa, the descendant of the great King Hintsa who was killed by the British in 1835, has passed on. He was installed by the democratic government in Nqadu in the Eastern Cape as the first overall king of AmaXhosa in January 2016 over the AmaRharhabe and AmaGcaleka clans. He was coronated in 2015 at Nqadu Great Place. King Sigcawu ruled over many towns (including Dutywa, Butterworth, Centane, and Willowvale) and 40 traditional councils (consisting of 34 chiefs and 167 headmen). He will be remembered, amongst other things, for his call on the President to get AbaThembu King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo released from prison. Black First Land First (BLF) sends its condolences to the family of the great King Sigcawu. We wish the family strength during this period. May the Black Gods comfort them all. Lala ngoxolo Sigcawu …
