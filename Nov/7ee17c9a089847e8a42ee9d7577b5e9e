I have observed with great concern the intensifying coordinated attacks on the chairperson of the Sekunjalo Group, Dr Iqbal Survé, over a long period of time. These attacks are clearly coordinated in a StratCom like manner. We are back to the apartheid era dirty tactics. The white owned media, from the Business Day to foreign funded covert operations like Amabhungane and Daily Maverick, is pushing blatant lies against Sekunjalo Independent Media. This is no doubt a part of the psychological war to demonize the group and its leaders so that an assault can be launched. I hereby call on these white owned foreign funded media outlets to respect media freedom and to forthwith stop their dirty tricks against Sekunjalo Independent Media and its chairperson. Vukani Community Development, which I am chairperson of, shall be mobilizing society to defend the Sekunjalo Group and media freedom. We say, “NO to apartheid censorship and dirty tactics!” Media freedom is a hard won freedom. We commit to defending it by any means necessary.
