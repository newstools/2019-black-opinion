An outright majority of UNGA member countries are expected to vote in favor of the resolution. However, Bruno Rodriguez, Cubaâ€™s Foreign Minister, has cautioned that the Trump administration is pressuring six Latin American countries to support the blockade. In 1991 Cuba tabled a draft resolution for the first time against the U.S. blockade on it. The Caribbean nation was however constrained to withdraw the said resolution due to pressure employed on member countries by Washington. In 1992, Cuba again presented its draft resolution. 59 member countries voted in favor of condemning the blockade, and 71 abstained. The U.S., Paraguay, Israel, and Albania voted against denouncing the blockade. Then in 2018, the resolution against the blockade was again presented. An overwhelming number of member countries voted in favor of the resolution. To this end 189 member countries voted in favor, and two voted against the resolution. The U.S. and Israel had voted against the resolution. There were no abstention. 27 resolutions have historically been passed by the UNGA against the U.S. blockade on Cuba with no practical execution. Cuba has suffered losses amounting to US$4.3 billion from April 2018 to March 2019; and more than US$920 billion over the last 60 years, as a result of the U.S. blockade. No related posts.
