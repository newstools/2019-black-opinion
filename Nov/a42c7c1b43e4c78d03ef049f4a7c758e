By Andile Mngxitama You still havenâ€™t registered? To RSVP send an email indicating your name, cell number, ward, region and province to blackfirstlandfirst@gmail.com I will deliver the presidential address at 11am. Be there at the Denis Hurley Centre, in Durban on 30 November on time to get accredited. Registration runs from 8am to 10am. In my address I will touch on the international situation, amongst other issues. I will canvass what Evo Morales (Bolivia); Muammar Gaddafi (Libya); and Robert Mugabe (Zimbabwe) teach us about sustaining a revolution? See you in Durban. Andile Mngxitama is the President of the radical black consciousness organization, Black First Land First (BLF). No related posts.
