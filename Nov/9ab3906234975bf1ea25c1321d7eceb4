By Andile Mngxitama I’m sorry to say we told you so. When people chose to vote for Cyril Ramaphosa claiming they were voting for the African National Congress (ANC), they very well knew they were giving Stellenbosch and London political power to deal with anyone perceived to be for Radical Economic Transformation (RET). It is evident that Stellenbosch and London are moving against Black First Land First (BLF) for its active pro RET stance. Remember the BLF26 were subjected to court processes relating to trumped-up charges of public violence, kidnapping, trespassing and intimidation for two years before those charges were withdrawn for lack of evidence. Well the BLF 26 leaders have now been summoned to appear in court for the same matter that was thrown out. Yes, the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) of the new administration has preferred different charges – based on the same cause of action which is BLF’s protest against Thuli Madonsela for her delay in finalizing her reports on white corruption – and reinstated the matter. President Zuma, the champion of RET, is in court today. He will lose the appeal. They are coming for all RET forces and those who voted for Cyril must take responsibility for this mess… Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
