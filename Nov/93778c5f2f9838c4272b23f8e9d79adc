By Andile Mngxitama I wonder if they still introduce students to the “sociology of schooling” in the humanities. I often listen to half baked politicians saying that education is the answer. It’s not! In a racist hierarchical anti black society like South Africa, education only reproduces the same system. Oh yes, they do allow a few children from working class backgrounds to come through to serve as sadistic managers of the same system. But any revolutionary should know that education doesn’t end inequality, racism and class privilege. In fact education increases these social differences.
