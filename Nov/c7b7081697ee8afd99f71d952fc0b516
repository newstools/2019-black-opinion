By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published on the Black First Land First website: On Saturday, 30 November 2019 at 08h00 sharp, we start the Black First Land First (BLF) Special Policy Conference at the Denis Hurley Centre in Durban. We shall unban the only revolutionary movement that has been banned since the dawn of “democracy”. Blacks need their own revolutionary movement. Land thieves are scared of BLF. BLF is guided by the Maoist principle: “Oppose everything the enemy supports and support everything the enemy opposes”. The enemy doesn’t want BLF registered with the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC). It is scared that black people are getting the Black First message. The enemy knows that BLF shall never sell out! See you in Durban!
