By Andile Mngxitama Saturday, 30 November at 8h00 sharp, Black First Land First (BLF) will meet in the Denis Hurley Centre to resolve how we move forward. We won’t allow land thieves to stop our march to freedom! We have received some very powerful suggestions, including a call to amend our constitution on membership criteria from “blacks only” to “strictly pro black.” There are also other suggestions.
