By Andile Mngxitama Twenty five (25) years into democracy, white households earn three times more than that of blacks. This relates only to the income of whites regarding salaries. Moreover it does not include inheritances and ownership of the economy on the part of whites. Our truth is offensive and threatening to the oppressor.
