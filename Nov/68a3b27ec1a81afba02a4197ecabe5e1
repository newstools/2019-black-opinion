The coup is a crime against the Bolivian people. We call on all of Bolivia’s political forces, including the people and their leaders, to act with responsibility in navigating the transition to the second elections, and deciding on the country’s future. We echo the solidarity messages of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, in “categorically condemn(ing) the consummated coup d’etat against the brother president Evo”; as well as the call of the Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel for “the world to mobilize for the life and freedom of Evo” Long live the Bolivian People!#ElMundoconEvo (the World with Evo) Issued by the National Coordinating Committee of Black First Land First (BLF NCC)
