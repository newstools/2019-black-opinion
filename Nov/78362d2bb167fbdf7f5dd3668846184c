News By Andile Mngxitama “You have to be mentally damaged as a person who earns an income to then take that which is supposed to help the vulnerable, the poor and the homeless” – Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng. I’m a big admirer of Judge Mogoeng. But I do find his analysis at times too moralistic and innocent. This is because of two main reasons: his Christian faith; and his faith in the Constitution. Corruption is not a disease committed by culprits who are “mentally damaged”, as described by the Chief Justice. Corruption is actually the core mechanism of the South African economy and political management. How did white people manage to own 80% of the land? How did they come to own over 90% of the economy? When President Zuma attempted to stop this systematic corruption, he was called corrupt and removed. The very same corruption drivers then gave Cyril Ramaphosa R1 billion to corrupt the entire African National Congress (ANC) elective conference in Nasrec. The corruption of politicians and civil servants is petty. It is organized by the bigger systematic corruption. In fact, the corrupt nature of the South African political econony makes it impossible to make an “honest” living. Just see how they have silenced some of the politicians with Louis Vuittons and Range Rovers. Andile Mngxitama is the President of the radical black consciousness organization, Black First Land First (BLF). No related posts.
