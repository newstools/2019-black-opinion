Less than 24 hours before Lula’s release, the Supreme Court of Brazil ruled that a convicted person can only serve a sentence of imprisonment after all the post trial appeals have been exhausted. Lula is currently appealing his convictions. His previous appeal was dismissed last year. “Our judicial battle continues, our focus is to get the legal case nullified”, Lula’s lawyer Cristiano Zanin said. Alluding to supporters who campaigned for his release Lula told the crowds who greeted him outside prison in Curitiba: “I didn’t think that today I could be here talking to the men and women that during 580 days shouted good morning, good afternoon or goodnight, no matter if it was raining or 40 degrees [Celsius]”. He slammed the Bolsanaro regime for attempting to “criminalize” his actions as well as his Workers’ Party. He announced that he will convene a meeting in Sao Paulo on Saturday which will be followed by a countrywide tour. The U.S. backed 2018 arrest of Lula, followed by his withdrawal from the presidential race, gave the right wing Jair Bolsanaro a clear run. Commenting on the former Brazilian president’s release Black First Land First President Andile Mngxitama said: “Lula is out! Im not celebrating. The whole Brazilian justice is exposed as biased and politically motivated just like in South Africa. They locked him up to prevent him from contesting the Presidency of Brazil. They let him go after the elections.” No related posts.
