By Andile Mngxitama London and Stellenbosch don’t need the Mazzoti boys anymore now that the Democratic Alliance (DA) has its President in Cyril Ramaphosa. It’s a cruel thing that white monopoly capital’s R1 billion has done at Nasrec – a DA President was elected by the African National Congress (ANC). What this means is that the ANC actually has no President. The DA rules through its ANC President. Mmusi Maimane was too stupid to understand this. And the DA has now come out and told all that it won’t be opposing the ANC. Why is that? It’s because it can’t oppose itself. The Mazzoti boys have been neutralized with threats of jail for looting VBS. So right now there is total hegemony of London and Stellenbosch – that’s why they are so scared of Black First Land First (BLF). They don’t want BLF near parliament or any other formal process. Too bad for them. This Saturday at the Special Policy Conference of BLF in Durban we unban our movement and give our people a real option. After that, the real hard work will start. We shall disrupt the Stellenbosch and London arrangement. See you in Durban #UnBanBLF Andile Mngxitama is the President of the radical black consciousness organization, Black First Land First (BLF).
