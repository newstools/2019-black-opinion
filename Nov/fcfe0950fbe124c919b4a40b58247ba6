Photo credit: SowetanLIVE By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published on the Black First Land First website: Black First Land First (BLF) condemns the application launched by the Public Investment Corporation (PIC) to liquidate Sekunjalo Independent Media (SIM). Evidently the PIC’s application is aimed at undermining the credibility of the Sekunjalo Group as well as destroying Independent Media, which is the main subsidiary of SIM. BLF maintains that there is an anti black campaign of slander, misinformation and lies conducted against Dr Iqbal Survé personally so as to destroy him and his businesses because he represents black excellence and success. Moreover the application to liquidate SIM is at the instance of white monopoly capital (WMC) interests who oppose media transformation in the country. Again we will not forget how WMC destroyed ANN7 because, just like Dr Survé’s media group, it exposed the agenda of white power. BLF stands with Dr Iqbal Survé and the Sekunjalo Group. #HandsOffDrIqbalSurvé! #HandsOffSIM!
