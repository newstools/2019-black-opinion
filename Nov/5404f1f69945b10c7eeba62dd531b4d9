By Andile Mngxitama A clever mechanism is being employed by black agents of white power to trick blacks into believing that there is a fight going on against racism, when in fact these agents are helping to prop up racism. A good example is seen in the political party of the Red Berets that gave power to the Democratic Alliance (DA), which is a racist political party of land thieves, and then turned around and claimed to be against the Springboks. It’s an acute case of Synthetic Rage Against Racism (SRAR) which we must be cautious of. SRAR‘s little cousins are pseudo factions created towards elective conferences. These are created to deflect attention from real issues of how a party has stopped being revolutionary and has in fact become a tool for the accumulation of good life for party bosses. To muddy the waters further, they even antagonise their student wing. The party is thus thrust into a superficial battle instead of addressing real questions of how it has aligned itself with white power and imperialism. Also the manner in which corruption neutralises any serious challenge to the status qou is removed from view. Beware… Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization. No related posts.
