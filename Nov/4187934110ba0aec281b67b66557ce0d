By Andile Mngxitama Black people have been too damaged. So I asked if it’s true that some villages had been without water for 3 months in the Eastern Cape (EC). People make it a joke and some even come with Olympics of suffering. They say sick shit like “that’s nothing“; “it’s hilarious“; and “my village has been without water since 1652”. Morons! It’s not a competition. For a village to have had water and subsequently got its supply cut off, is a massive attack on the dignity of a people. That’s not a case for competition with the obvious horrible reality of no access to water in your own village. There is a regime of brutality and spite generated by the colonial mindset. It says, “if I don’t have something, you too must not have it”. It’s not a case of water for all and empathy with whomever is denied. We bewitch each other because you have 5 chickens and I have two. It’s sick! Colonial minds! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization. No related posts.
