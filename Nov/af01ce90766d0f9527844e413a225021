Photo credit: metro By Andile Mngxitama In the days of my youth when Nelson Mandela was still alive I regarded him as a sellout. This was when it wasn’t popular to call him a sellout. Immediately after his death I enquired, “what have white people done to acknowledge Mandela’s magnanimity towards them? He gave them so much, what have they given back?” Nowadays I say, “Mandela cut a deal to get the state (being the army, police, secret service, and courts) in the hands of black people. It’s the cowardice of the ANC that makes them refuse to use the state to smash Stellenbosch and free the land…” One day I will write more about this… Andile Mngxitama is the President of the radical black consciousness organization, Black First Land First (BLF).
