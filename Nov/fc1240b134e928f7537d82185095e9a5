By Andile Mngxitama These chaps steal from the poor and eat their money. The story is on the front page of today’s Sunday Times. Their problem is that they leave a paper trail. They really thought that they were protected from StratCom when they joined hands against President Zuma. Also remember how they were having dinners with Johann Rupert? He must have assured them all is good. However, Pravin Gordhan is revealing their files to the media. They are certainly being properly managed. That’s why there will be no challenge to Cyril Ramaphosa in parliament. There will also not be any serious action for land expropriation without compensation. In the meantime white monopoly capital (WMC) and the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) keep on threatening jail… Let’s check the various options available to the Mazzotti boys. They can: i. Sue the newspapers for lying. Why not? I mean they did sue their own members recently. ii. Take the newspaper to the Press Ombudsman for writing lies about them. iii. Come out and confess, and also ask for forgiveness for collapsing VBS for cars and houses. VBS was the only black bank we ever had. The comprador is clearly too compromised to lead the struggle against capital and colonialism. The best contribution of these guys will be taking their party into coalitions with the Democratic Alliance. Andile Mngxitama is the President of the radical black consciousness organization, Black First Land First (BLF). No related posts.
