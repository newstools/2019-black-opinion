By Andile Mngxitama If you are one of those people who believes that parliament is totally irrelevant, can you please explain why blacks the wolrd over had to always put up big struggles to get the right to vote? Why didnâ€™t whites just give blacks this right? Also answer this, why is the Freedom Front Plus (FF+) and the Democratic Alliance (DA) doing everything possible to stop Black First Land First from going to parliament? Thanks! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization. No related posts.
