This is the disgrace which has become normal for the black majority. The disgrace and neglect of black people has to end now! The best way to honor the memory of the late King, who lived like his people, is to insist that the South African government implement the Thomas Sankara Oath. This oath calls for the President, Ministers, Members of Parliament and all senior managers in the state to use public hospitals by law. It makes it a criminal offence for state and political leaders to use private hospitals. The National Health Insurance is a joke. Public hospitals are falling apart. Politicians and public servants have abandoned the public hospitals for the private sector. The ordeal the King had suffered is because those who make decisions about public hospitals don’t have to use them, hence they let them decay and become places of death instead of places of healing. In memory of King Sigcawu, Black First Land First (BLF) calls on parliament to make the Thomas Sankara Oath, law. It’s time to put the people first! BLF will be undertaking a national petition to force parliament to do the right thing and implement the Thomas Sankara Oath. The full text of the Thomas Sankara Oath, can be read via the link, https://blf.org.za/policy-documents/the-thomas-sankara-oath/ Issued by Black First Land First, National Coordinating Committee of (BLF NCC)
