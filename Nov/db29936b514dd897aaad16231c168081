By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published on the Black First Land First website: The Black First Land First Student Movement will love to add its voice into the many that are bemoaning the continued imprisonment of Khanya Cekeshe. Khanya Cekeshe, like Bonginkosi Khanyile and many others, is not a criminal but a young person who fought for a just cause, the human right to be educated. BLF-SM calls on all Black people who love Black liberation to support all actions taken to ensure the freedom of Khanya Cekeshe and all other political prisoners, including the protest marches scheduled for Pretoria and Cape Town. BLF-SM further supports the application for Khanya Cekeshe to be pardoned by the President of the country for the conviction of all Fees Must Fall “offences”. We further support the establishment of a TRC like commission to solve the many unsolved issues, pertaining to student struggles. #FreeKhanyaCekeshe Issued by the Black First Land First Student Movement
