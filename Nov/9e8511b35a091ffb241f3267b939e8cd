By Andile Mngxitama Let me show you something. They say that we must all do PhDs right? Ok right. Do you know why? It’s because they are in a process of degrading the value (not so much the substance) of the PhD through the logic of the tyranny of the market. Do you remember your sociology or economics 101 at high school? They tell you about “supply and demand”. Remember what you were told about there being a high supply of a particular product? Do you also remember you were told that a high supply of a thing devalues it? Yes, that’s what the system has decided to do with PhDs now that blacks are getting their paper ready. Again I’m not saying that you must not do the PhD, but you must know what to expect with that qualification. By the way, I’m shocked by what some universities pay their faculty employees. If you have no inheritance I don’t know how you are going to survive at entry level… Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
