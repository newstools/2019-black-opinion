By Andile Mngxitama The victory of Cyril Ramaphosa’s white monopoly capital (WMC) sponsored campaign at the African National Congress (ANC) elective conference at Nasrec, was the defeat of all revolutionary people and movements even outside the ruling party. Towards Nasrec there was a momentum within the ANC for a leftwing shift under the banner of Radical Economic Transformation (RET) represented by President Zuma. RET is a minimum program to unite all those who correctly understand that the primary contradiction in South Africa (SA) is WMC. Today save for a few ANC leaders who are under attack by WMC and its agents, the whole of the party’s top leadership is captured. The state apparatuses are also used to criminalize the RET forces. Those of us who claim to be on the LEFT must recognize that the progressive current inside the ANC is on the retreat. Also recognize that there is no coherent LEFT program and momentum right now. In parliament there is essentially one political party. The top three parties are in the pockets of London and Stellenbosch. We need to regroup as the LEFT beyond political party affiliation and reclaim the RET program for a forward move. Black First Land First (BLF) will be getting its house in order next week Saturday. We are ready to lead the real LEFT movement towards a real fight with WMC. Andile Mngxitama is the President of BLF, a radical black consciousness organization.   No related posts.
