Photo credit: Green Left Weekly Statement by the Political Committee of the Movimiento Al Socialismo (Movement for Socialism) of Bolivia* Resist today to fight again tomorrow Today, November 10, Bolivia’s humble citizens, its workers, the Aymara and Quechua peoples, we begin the long road of resistance to defend the historical achievements of the first indigenous government that ended today with the forced resignation of our president Evo Morales at the hands of a civilian-police coup. Let history bear witness to our commitment to defend the nationalizations and industrialization program, our public companies, and our social policies and national symbols. Today the right and the coup plotters seized the Wiphala (our indigenous banner and the dual of the Bolivian nation), and with it, they tore down our dignity as indigenous peoples. We will not kneel, we will defend our constitutional symbols. Over the coming days, the hunting down of our comrades will continue. Our responsibility is to safeguard one another like a family, to rebuild the social fabric, to care for and protect our persecuted leaders. Today is the moment of solidarity, tomorrow will be the time for reorganization and to the step forward in the struggle that will not end with these sad events. Our slogan is to resist today to fight again tomorrow. Our actions will defend the achievements of the greatest government in the history of Bolivia. Our country or Death!!! The MAS makes history, the right is disgrace!!! November 10, 2019 Bolivia Originally published in Spanish at Rebelión.org and thereafter in English on No Borders No related posts.
