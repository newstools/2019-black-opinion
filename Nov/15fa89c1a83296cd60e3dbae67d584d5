By Andile Mngxitama Dear RET forces inside the ANC, My leaders I got bad news for you. Cyril Ramaphosa will not be removed as President by the National General Council (NGC). Let me remind you. You voted for Ramaphosa who was bought by white monopoly capital (WMC). WMC didn’t use R1 billion to buy a president only to give him up. It will not let go of him without going to war. Again. WMC has ruled for the last 350 years through bribes. It kills those it can’t bribe. So whoever told you that you must vote for Ramaphosa and they will remove him, lied to you. In fact he is going to get his second term. I’m sorry to bring you bad news like this. No related posts.
