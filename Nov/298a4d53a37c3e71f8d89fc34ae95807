By Andile Mngxitama Dear blacks, For so called Black Friday, while you buy your stuff from the same white monopoly capital shops we buy from, please just don’t kill each other in a stampede. White monopoly capital ensures that there is almost nothing that is not owned by the people who oppress us. So we are compelled to buy their products until the revolution comes and then we take stuff over. In the meantime, the best Black Friday is when villagers or people from informal settlements stop a truck transporting pigs and liberate them into their hungry stomachs… Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
