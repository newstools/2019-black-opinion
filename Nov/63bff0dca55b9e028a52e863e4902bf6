Photo credit: BusinessLIVE By Andile Mngxitama Black senior journalists, working for the white owned media, are engaging in a psychological warfare against Sekunjalo Independent Media (SIM). They attack Sekunjalo because it’s not owned by their white bosses. White monopoly capital (WMC) and its black journalist stooges are determined to see Independent Media, and in fact the entire Sekunjalo Group, fall. WMC don’t want blacks to have black role models. Hence they want to destroy the leader of Sekunjalo, Dr Iqbal Survé, who represents black excellence and success. Black journalists hence attack Sekunjalo in furtherance of white interests. They want to ANN7 it. We must not let that happen! #HandsOffDrIqbalSurvé! #HandsOffSIM! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
