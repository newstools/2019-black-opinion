Getty images By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published on the Black First Land First website: Afriforum is using the money it gets from stolen land and apartheidâ€™s preferential labour practices to defend whites who murder blacks. The two white men, Pieter Doorewaard and Phillip Schutte, who murdered a black child on 20 April 2017 in Coligny in the North West, has been granted bail on the instigation of Afriforum. The two were found guilty for the murder of 16 year old Matlhomola Mosweu. Mosweu was murdered on a sunflower farm for taking one of its flowers to eat its seeds. Upon being convicted and sentenced to terms of imprisonment by the court, Afriforum got the two out on bail of R20 000 pending an appeal. The right wing Afriforum in fact funded the whole process and to this end secured the services of advocate Barry Roux. Black First Land First (BLF) is not surprised at all that the murderers
of Mosweu have been assisted by Afriforum which is unashamedly racist. We wish to warn blacks about this racist outfit. Afriforum uses black people to legitimize itself so that it can do its apartheid work in peace. It has never assisted a victim of racism. BLF further notes how our courts seem to always jump when Afriforum says so. The courts are becoming another wing of Afrikanersdom.
