Photo credit: SA History Online By Yerushka Chetty One hundred and fifty nine (159) years ago the first ship carrying Indians docked at Durban Harbor, in KwaZulu-Natal. Many others followed. They were brought to South Africa (SA) to become indentured slaves. Steve Biko would later classify them as black in terms of black consciousness. 159 years ago those who didn’t slave for the white supremacist system did not eat and died of starvation. Those who resisted were met with state sponsored brutality, ridiculed and marginalized from society. Today this is the fear of the so called working class and the reality of the unemployed. Slavery has not ended in SA. It has become normalized. We are the descendants of generations of slaves who knew they were slaves. Many of us today, suffer from a mental illness like delusion, induced by the “miracle” of 1994, that makes us believe that we are free. The so called Indians (like all blacks) bear and grow another generation of slaves but this time without the tools to fight slavery (and indeed colonialism and apartheid) because of this mental illness of new democracy that makes us believe we are free, when we remain slaves. We are a generation of caregivers who wittingly or unwittingly mould gentle slaves to be devoured by the white supremacist system. “Obey all the rules, but hustle”, we tell our children. “The state and the private sector will take care of you if you are super good, meek and diligent”, we assure them. Today, on this 159th anniversary of their arrival in this country, let’s salute the generation of people who knew they were being treated as slaves and fought a good fight! Aluta continua!
