By Andile Mngxitama The Democratic Alliance (DA) is a right wing white supremacist political party. It has accordingly elected its white men to lead it. We will see how the leadership of the Red Berets who have given the same DA political power in the metros (for tenders), are going to complain about how racist it is while they keep it in power. This is what I call “Synthetic Rage Against Racism” (SRAR). Since when was the DA not racist? Our problem is that black leaders are using the suffering of blacks to get Louis Vuittons and Range Rovers. They don’t really care about racism and black oppression. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization. No related posts.
