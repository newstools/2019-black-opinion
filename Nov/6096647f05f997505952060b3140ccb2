By Andile Mngxitama The leaders of the Red Berets who have dinners and are advisers of Johann Rupert (remember they advised Rupert to do the interview with PowerFM), are angry that the Springboks had a braai with Rupert. Do they want Rupert to themselves? Jacob Zuma, who we are told is very corrupt, has called for his taxes to be openly scrutinized. However Cyril Ramaphosa, who is promoted as being very clean and integrous, is concealing his financial records. Is the corrupt Zuma more transparent than Mr Clean? Freedom Front Plus (FF+) is a whites only racist boerestaad party. It is allowed to exist but Black First Land First (BLF) – a movement for blacks only that fights against slavery, colonialism and apartheid – is deregistered. Does it mean that democracy prevents blacks from fighting for their freedom? Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
