Photo credit: Siphiwe Mhlambi By BO Staff Writer The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has made a decision to charge On Point Engineering and its three directors – Lesiba Gwangwa, Kagiso Dichabe and Thomas Rasetlhaba – with tender fraud in that they had made misrepresentations to the Limpopo Department of Transport. Gwangwa will further be charged for allegedly lying that his company was not paid by the department for certain work done when it had in truth received payment in excess of R8-million. In the meantime the NPA has opened another investigation into how Julius Malema managed his Ratanang Family Trust. It is unclear why a separate investigation has been opened in this respect, when Malema’s Ratanang Family Trust is in fact a shareholder in On Point Engineering. Malema is alleged to have benefited from tender fraud via payments made by On Point into his Ratanang family trust. The Public Protector, the SIU, the Hawks and the Asset Forfeiture Unit have already found against On Point for wrongdoing committed by it in relation to the Limpopo government. No related posts.
