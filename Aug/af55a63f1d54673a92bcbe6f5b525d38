By a Andile Mngxitama There are more revelations on the #RamaphosaLeaks. I’m sure that by now, you have seen the over 400 page financial records of the CR17 campaign. The material was leaked either last night or this morning. My hunch is that it was released by the CR17 spin doctors to try and steal the headlines from possibly the Sunday Independent – (please note im making deductions from my own assumptions). A quick read of the leaked financials show that Bosasa actually may have paid over R100 million to the CR17 campaign. It looks like there was direct buying of delegates with sums of money from R2500 to up to millions of rands depending on the influence of those paid. There are also direct payments of accommodation and transport that run into millions of rands. The bottom line is that the African National Congress (ANC) Nasrec conference was bought with money donated to the CR17 campaign and therefore the current State President is illegitimate. Black First Land First (BLF) shall be moving on the saboteurs of the democratic will of the people by buying a President. This is the biggest scandal since 1994. It is subversion of the democratic order. The big surprise is the silence of all the major political parties and institutions that have claimed to fight corruption. There is only one conclusion, Ramaphosa must go! Andile Mngxitama is the President of BLF No related posts.
