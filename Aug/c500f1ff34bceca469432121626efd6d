By Andile Mngxitama Are you confused about the Gavin Watson affair? Let me break it down for you: 1. Mr A deposits R500 000 into Mr B’s account.
2. Mr B is a lawyer who set up the account on behalf of Mr C.
3. Mr C will use the money to buy a conference so that it elects him President of South Africa (SA). Mr C used the money to buy the African National Congress (ANC) Nasrec Conference in December 2017. From there Mr C became the State President of SA. This whole scheme was exposed by the Sunday Independent journalist, Piet Rampedi. Now, Mr B, being the person in whose account the bribe in the form of money was deposited, suddenly died in his sleep and was hurried immediately. A week later, Mr A, being the person who deposited the cash into Mr B’s account, died from a very suspicious accident. Mr C, who is now the State President is out of the country and identified as “unidentified leader”. Within a week both Mr A (depositor) and Mr B (the person whose account was used to receive the money) are DEAD! GET IT NOW? Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First, a radical black consciousness movement. No related posts.
