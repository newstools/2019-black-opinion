By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published on the Black First Land First website and is now reissued by Black Opinion: Black First Land First (BLF) calls on the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) to stop its “ja baas” attitude and deal with the petulant racism of AfriForum decisively. AfriForum’s leader, Ernst Roets, has clearly and unapologetically violated the court’s decision sought by the SAHRC and the Mandela Foundation. It’s shocking that the SAHRC is mumbling and talking about investigations when the racist Roets is openly defying the court’s decision made this Wednesday that the “gratuitous display” of the apartheid flag constitutes hate speech, unfair discrimination, and harassment based on race in terms of Sections 10(1), 7 and 11 of the Equality Act respectively. The “askies my baas” attitude displayed by the SAHRC gives credence to the claim that their court application to declare the display of the apartheid flag hate speech, was just a ruse to deflect attention from the #RamaphosaLeaks. BLF calls on the SAHRC to show some spine and do its work by immediately taking action against Roets. If the SAHRC fears white racists who treat blacks with contempt, then BLF itself will deal with the racist in its own way and the SAHRC must not cry.
