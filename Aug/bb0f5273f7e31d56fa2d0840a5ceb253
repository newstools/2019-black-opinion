By Andile Mngxitama When white monopoly capital (WMC): i. came for the Guptas, some of us helped them;
ii. destroyed ANN7, some of us celebrated;
iii. came for President Zuma, some amongst us helped;
iv. destroyed Brian Molefe, some of us helped to finished him off;
v. came for Black First Land First (BLF), some of us celebrated. Moreover, when they: i. fought the Khoi and the San, other groups looked on;
ii. fought the 100 years war with the Xhosa speaking group, other groups folded their arms;
iii. fought the Zulu speaking group, other groups did nothing. By the time they fought the Gaza King Ngungunyane Mdungazi, we were all defeated. That’s how colonists defeated us. I won’t say anything about those who collaborated with the colonizers, calling them the better devil, against other blacks. In the end they oppressed all blacks, their stooges included. How they divide us is simple. They give a bit of money to others and praise them. They make them love stupid things like exclusive country clubs, horses and debauchery. So that’s how we stay divided and they come for each of us individually untill no one is left… Now they are coming for the Public Protector, Busisiwe Mkhwebane, and some of us are cheering them. Later they will finish off Julius Malema, the man who helped them so much. If we don’t unite, we shall perish together… simple as that … Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First No related posts.
