By Andile Mngxitama Don’t lose focus. It’s not about Gavin Watson. It’s about how land thieves bought themselves a President with R1 billion.
Where are the rest of the buyers who contributed to the CR17 campaign slush fund to buy the African National Congress (ANC) Nasrec conference? Why do we allow ourselves to be ruled by a man who is in the pocket of white monopoly capital (WMC)? Watson was not eliminated because he is corrupt. He was eliminated to hide the evidence of how Cyril Ramaphosa used the money gained from him corruptly so as to buy the ANC Nasrec conference. Our eyes must stay on the prize! The silence from the ‘Zuma Must Go’ brigade tells us that the money was used to gag too many people. At least two members of parliament (MPs), who were from the party of the Reds of London, have fallen on their swords. And Cyril says that he helped more members of the Reds. So there you are… Clearly, Watson was removed so that evidence can disappear. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First, a revolutionary black consciousness movement.
