By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published on the Black First Land First website and is now reissued by Black Opinion: It has come to the attention of our revolutionary movement that jewelry worth over R300 million was repossessed without compensation from the warehouse of Johann Rupert. This brave act of repossession must be applauded. We hope that those who repossessed the jewelry are black people. Only black people have a legitimate right to take back that which belongs to them. All the mineral wealth in South Africa was stolen from black people. Black First Land First (BLF) will ask both the South African Revenue Service (SARS) and the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) to investigate Johann Rupert for possible tax evasion, money laundering and possession of illicit goods. Why would a warehouse keep jewelry to the value of up to R300 million? As long as the historical mass robbery of black people of their land and wealth is not corrected such acts of repossession, if conducted by blacks, are infinitely revolutionary. 11 August 2019 Contact Details Black First Land First Mail: blackfirstlandfirst@gmail.com Zanele Lwana
