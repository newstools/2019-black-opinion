Vukani Community Development (Vukani) has learned with great regret that Parliament has decided to establish special rules to start the process of removing Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane as the Public Protector. Vukani respects the democratic values fought for by the likes of Nelson Mandela. Robert Sobukwe and Steve Biko. We support all actions and other efforts in furtherance of these values. Moreover as Vukani, we believe that black politicians and public servants who tirelessly work in state institutions to serve the people, need to be defended. We are therefore gravely concerned about the unconscionable attacks on the incumbent Public Protector, Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane. Rules are urgently being formulated by parliament to remove Chapter 9 Institutions with the sole purpose of removing the Public Protector who earlier found that the President had lied to parliament and to this end, had broken his oath of office. As a community organization, Vukani is proud of the great work that Advocate Mkhwebane is doing in the interests of our people, both on the ground and on the level of furthering accountable governance. Vukani applauds the Public Protectorâ€˜s dedication, bravery and unwavering commitment to the cause. She is under attack precisely because of her courage in standing on the side of the truth. We call on government to stop the witch-hunt against Advocate Mkhwebane. We say Hands Off the Public Protector.
