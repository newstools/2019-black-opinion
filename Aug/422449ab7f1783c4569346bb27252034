By Andile Mngxitama In 2021 the anti black South African Communist Party (SACP) turns 100 years. Good time to avenge black nationalism and all the black revolutionaries destroyed by the racist so called communists. Hopefully black radicals will put together a publication dedicated to the victims of the SACP. Anyway, lookout for a call for papers. Remember their 1922 slogan – ‘White workers of the world unite!?’ They haven’t changed! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF) No related posts.
