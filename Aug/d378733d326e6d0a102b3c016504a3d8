By Andile Mngxitama Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi passes on the political baton this weekend. I hope his biographers will be fair to him. I wonder what Nobleman “Mzala” Nxumalo would say now, looking at the Prince’s legacy and those of his political detractors. And yes, let me say it upfront. When I got to meet him in person, I found him too charming, warm and fatherly. He always gives me a warm hug and reminds me that, “you are the most controversial politician in SA”. I don’t argue with elders. When we evaluate the legacy of Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi we must factor in the following: 1. After 25 years of democracy the African National Congress (ANC) bought back only 8% of the land from whites with over R50 billion!
2. Over night the Prince negotiated for 3% of the land to vest in the Ingonyama Trust, for free, as a condition to participate in the elections.
3. The National Party has dissolved itself into the ANC. Remember the Prince was called a sellout for working within the Bantustan process of the NP.
4. The current President of the ANC is openly funded by land thieves and apartheid capitalists like the Oppenheimers.
5. The current President of the ANC has a massacre under his belt, the Marikana massacre.
6. The apartheid leaders who ordered the massacres of our people are not only holding Noble Peace Prizes but are enjoying their retirement on nice state pensions. These factors make adverse judgement and condemnation of the Prince unfair. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First, a radical black consciousness movement. No related posts.
