By Andile Mngxitama I see white people are calling Julius out for flying first class. Lets be clear! We detest the gluttonous conspicuous consumption of the neocolonialists. But that’s between us and them. Whites who are calling Juju out must shut the fuck up. They are the ones who corrupted Julius with Stellenbosch money and exclusive Country Club lifestyles. Yes, we abhor pseudo Marxist Leninists who spit on the face of the poor. But we are clear – it’s a matter between us and them. Whites must step aside and give us back the land. The white power structure has corrupted black leaders. Now they are held hostage by it through money and consumption to rob our people of true representation. See how quiet the first class ticket has made Juju in parliament? No one says leaders must live like street kids, but living first class donning Louis Vuitton and Gucci is despicable. But can whites give us space to criticize and call out our own? Is that too hard? We can now see why the Reds of Mazzotti abandoned the Sankara Oath.
