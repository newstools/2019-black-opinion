By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published on the Black First Land First website and is now reissued by Black Opinion: Black First Land First (BLF) notes the media reports that the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) will soon announce its decision on whether to prosecute Julius Malema or not. This case is clearly being prioritized because it is instituted by the racist organization of land thieves, whose cases are always fast tracked. BLF also opened a case against the white owned security company which allegedly provided the gun in question. The South African law prescribes that it is illegal for gun owners to hand over guns to unauthorized persons. Where is the case we opened? This hurry to prosecute black people by the NPA seems to be its policy in fact. BLF has opened several high profile cases which have been ignored, including cases against FW de Klerk; the Oppenheimer family; Johann Rupert; Adriano Mazzoti; Maria Ramos; Pravin Gordhan and host of others like, Markus Jooste. Since laying criminal charges, nothing further has happened to these cases. BLF will seek an urgent meeting with the NPA to get clarity on its cases and to raise our strong held view that the NPA is biased.
