By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published on the Black First Land First website and is now reissued by Black Opinion: It’s plain shocking that the HAWKS have literally jumped at the barking of shady organizations that seem associated with the corrupt Independent Power Producers (IPPs) which are collapsing ESKOM. The complaint against the Public Protector, Busisiwe Mkhwebane, has no merit in fact or in law. The complainant is the so called Accountability Now which is a white organization with apparently the sole purpose of maintaining the anti black status quo under the pretext of fighting corruption. It’s shocking that the Hawks have chosen to be a tool of these racist organizations which are opposed to Radical Economic Transformation (RET) and progressive black leadership. Black First Land First (BLF) asks the hawks to leave the Public Protector alone to do her job without fear or favor. Furthermore, BLF asks the Hawks to focus on the numerous cases BLF has opened against white monopoly capital (WMC) where no prograss has been made at all. In fact BLF now believes that cases against white WMC are never investigated.
