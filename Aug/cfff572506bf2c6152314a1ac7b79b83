By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published on the Black First Land First website and is now reissued by Black Opinion: BLF denounces the South African National Editorsâ€™ Forum (Sanef) Panel of Inquiry into Media Credibility and Ethics. We believe that it is a mechanism to whitewash the many bad acts of journalism and the open bias of the mainstream media against Radical Economic Transformation (RET). The fact that the same Sanef has been silent on many occasions of abuses of media freedom, including the shutting down of ANN7, makes their Panel of Inquiry not a credible process. We call for an Independent Media Tribunal with a sound regulatory framework to monitor and address any violation of the principles of ethical journalism in the media.
