By Andile Mngxitama If you don’t believe that white monopoly capital (WMC) can murder it’s own to protect itself, then you underestimate London and Stellenbosch. Gavin Watson was taken out to ensure that if he goes down, his damning evidence will also go with him and Ramaphosa will stay in office. The ruling class is not the Guptas. They don’t play with power. Dr Neely Fuller Jr teaches us that a part of maintaining white supremacy is “white sacrifice” – that the system of white supremacy does, from time to time, sacrifice a few whites to strengthen itself. Watson knew too much and he was compromised. He had to go! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First, a revolutionary black consciousness movement. No related posts.
