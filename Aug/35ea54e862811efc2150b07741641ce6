By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published on the Black First Land First website and is now reissued by Black Opinion: Our country is in a deep moral and leadership crisis. President Ramaphosa is accused of crimes that render him a hired agent in the state house. The findings of the Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane; the leaked emails; and the constant lying of the President suggest that a bandit is occupying the highest office of the land. White monopoly capital (WMC) has raised between half a billion to a billion rands to fund the capture of the African National Congress (ANC) conference. The objective of pouring in such an amount of resources was to capture the state by buying for itself the state President. What else were the hundreds of millions for? Black First Land First (BLF) calls for a forensic audit on the CR17 campaign funds so as to get to the bottom of how the money was used. Suggestions about how a current Minister in Ramaphosa’s Cabinet was the point man to buy delegates at NASREC to vote for Ramaphosa, are not inconsistent with the evidence of corruption and money laundering that the Public Protector’s report indicates. BLF maintains that overwhelming evidence shows that Cyril Ramaphosa is an illegitimate President. If the funds collected for the CR17 campaign were not used for state capture, then there should be no difficulty on Ramaphosa’s part with a forensic audit being conducted.
