By Andile Mngxitama Zakes Mda is defending the gluttony of the Reds of London because he’s angry with the African National Congress (ANC) for not giving him the recognition he believes he deserves. In defence of the Gucci and Louis Vuitton ones he says that it’s not necessary to be poor to help the poor. Fool, can you answer this? i. Who made the poor, poor?
ii. Who gave money to the leaders not to be poor when they represent the poor?
iii. You think that taking a stand to end poverty is an act of charity and doing a favour for the poor? Here we have globally renowned writers who are illiterate in “political economy”. How are you writing without having a grasp of how the social and political order functions? How can we end poverty when our leaders are in the pockets of those who create poverty? The Professor has forgotten that there is a direct correlation between wealth and poverty in a capitalist order like ours. Zakes makes me tired. Give me Lewis Nkosi anyday… No we arent poor by choice. It’s an outcome of a system that has bought our leaders with shiny things and first class lives. No one can help the poor. Only a revolution to end this system will end poverty. No one is doing the poor a favour. Jirrr! Zakes Mda is one of the most dim witted overrated South African writers.
