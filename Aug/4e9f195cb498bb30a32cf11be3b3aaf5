By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published on the Black First Land First website and is now reissued by Black Opinion: Black First Land First (BLF) calls on the African National Congress (ANC) to immediately suspend Cyril Ramaphosa as its President and remove him as President of the country. The leaked emails have not been denied and show beyond reasonable doubt that Ramaphosa is compromised, conflicted, and corrupt. Worse still he is beholden to white monopoly capital (WMC) in that he is bought by it. It is also clear that Ramaphosa is protected by the WMC judiciary. The consequences of this reality is that there shall be no meaningful change in the lives of our people. The #RamaphosaLeaks show that: 1. Ramaphosa lied to parliament and the nation.
2. Ramaphosa is corrupt.
3. Ramaphosa conspired with WMC to buy the presidency of the ANC in the December 2017 NASREC conference.
4. Ramaphosa is a captured President by Stellenbosch and London.
5. Ramaphosa has already given the country to his handlers.
6. Ramaphosa is protected by the WMC media.
7. Pravin Gordhan is central to the conspiracy to buy the ANC conference with money from Stellenbosch and London.
8. Ramaphosa is an illegitimate President. BLF is clear! Ramaphosa must go!!! Right now no women or men of integrity have emerged from within the ANC with the moral rectitude to call for Ramaphosa to go. Even the Umkhonto we Sizwe Military Veterans Association (MKMVA) people are silent! THIS IS A DISGRACE!!! Again, BLF is clear! Ramaphosa must go! He said he is fighting corruption, whilst being the most corrupt!
