By BO Staff Writer Yesterday, President Ramaphosa applied to the Gauteng High Court to seal certain bank statements contained in the Bosasa report of the Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane. Black First Land First(BLF) President Andile Mngxitama responded as follows to this news: “This is WMC doing corruption legally. You have to respect Stellenbosch. They are basically asking the court to help them with corruption. I give up! Ramaphosa has no shame. They are literally going to court to get an order to conceal corruption. These people said Zuma was corrupt. But them, they do corruption legally. No man this is too much!” Ramaphosa claims that the information he seeks to seal is confidential, belongs to third parties, and may have been unlawfully obtained by the Public Protector. It’s appalling that Ramaphosa wants to prevent the state, judiciary and public at large from scrutinizing his bank accounts through which his African National Congress (ANC) presidential campaign funds were illegally processed. These accounts include the EFG2 account, Ramaphosa’s foundation account, Linked Environmental Services, and Ria Tenda Trust. The Public Protector based her findings (against Ramaphosa) on material evidence, including the bank statements of the accounts mentioned herein. She found damning evidence against Ramaphosa, which includes that of money laundering relating to the R500 000 donation made by Bosasa CEO Gavin Watson to his ANC presidential campaign. The subsequent #RamaphosaLeaks confirmed the correctness of the Public Protector’s findings. The findings of the Public Protector suggests that Ramaphosa, and by extension the state, is hijacked by white monopoly capital (WMC). This means that Ramaphosa seeks to conceal evidence that proves his criminal offences which in turn are in services of WMC. If the Court grants Ramaphosa’s the order he seeks it would suggests further proof that the judiciary is indeed captured by WMC. No related posts.
