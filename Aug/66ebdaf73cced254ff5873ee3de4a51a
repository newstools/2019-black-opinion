By Andile Mngxitama For the first time since 1994, I think that those who stand in the way of London and Stellenbosch will be physically eliminated. The state has fallen into the hands of rogues. Brace yourselves for a difficult period ahead. We choose to deal white monopoly capital (WMC) a blow. The are two options: take the WMC donations and shut up; or fight to the bitter end. Black First Land First (BLF) chooses to fight to the end! Andile Mngxitama is the President of BLF. No related posts.
