By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published on the Black First Land First website and is now reissued by Black Opinion: The President of Black First Land First (BLF), Andile Mngxitama, has accepted the apology from the Judicial Commission of Inquiry into Allegations of State Capture, (Zondo Commission) on behalf of our movement.   The apology follows the unexplained denial of access of the BLF President, to the Zondo Commission hearing on the first day of its sitting before which the former President Zuma was appearing. The police and security of the Zondo Commission claimed that there was a standing rule that denied access to the hearings of the commission to people wearing political party regalia. When they were asked to show the rule they relied on to prevent the BLF President from attending the hearing, they failed to do so. They nonetheless still prevented him from entering the venue of the hearing. . BLF hopes that the Zondo Commission can pay more attention to what’s happening inside its institution. The one hand of the commission needs to really make an effort to know what the other hand is doing. The unreasonable actions of the police and the commission’s security suggests inherent hostility towards supporters of Zuma, like BLF. This really makes us question whether Zuma will get a fair hearing. BLF now awaits for an apology from the Minister of Police Mr Bheki Cele.
