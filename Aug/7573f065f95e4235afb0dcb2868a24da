By Andile Mngxitama In South Africa (SA) the political agenda of the big three parties is set by the racist Democratic Alliance (DA). Let me explain: 1. The DA was big with the Zuma Must Go campaign which included the Nkandla issue – the others followed. 2. The DA set the agenda with the narrative that blacks are corrupt. It was called the better devil and given political power by the third biggest party. They all consequently continued to loot in peace. 3. The DA said that the problem is not high unemployment or the untransformed econony but “foreign nationals”. The African National Congress (ANC) has adopted this anti black stance and taken over the DA’s agenda in that respect. In fact the 2021 elections in the Metros will be about who can send the “foreign nationals” home faster. 4. The DA set the agenda for full privatization of state-owned enterprises (SOEs). The ruling party had heeded the call. This agenda is moving full steam ahead! Clearly, the racist anti black DA sets the national political agenda the rest follow… Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF) No related posts.
