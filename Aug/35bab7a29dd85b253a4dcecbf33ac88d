By BO Staff Writer Oliver Meth, who styles himself as a journalist, has been exposed by campaign records as being a recipient of funds from the CR17 campaign. Sunday Independent journalist, Piet Rampedi, tweeted as follows:  Since the exposure he has confirmed being paid by the CR17 campaign for his work as a media consultant for the CR17 campaign He remarked as follows on Twitter:  Meth further stated that he cannot reveal the details of his work as he has been sworn to secrecy by the CR17 campaign. He has evidently served as agency for white monopoly capital (WMC) via the media’s efforts in ensuring that Ramaphosa becomes President of the country. Rampedi commented that Meth was not the only one on the “CR17 payroll”, others too were paid by the campaign. He tweeted as follows:  Evidence in the public domain, suggests that the election campaign of Ramaphosa was paid for by white monopoly capital (WMC) so as to enable him to buy the 2017 African National Congress (ANC) Nasrec Conference and ultimately become President of the country. In rebuking Meth’s role in the CR17 campaign, Andile Mngxitama, the President of the radical black consciousness movement Black First Land First (BLF), had this to say: “Oliver Meth was never a journalist. He was always a hit man for white power. He is a paid agent”. No related posts.
