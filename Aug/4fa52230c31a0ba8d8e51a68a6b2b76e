By Andile Mngxitama Let me repeat. London and Stellenbosch didn’t spend R1 billion to buy a president to give him up, all like that. It’s going to be war and people are going to die. It’s like when the mob says, “going to the mattresses.” The ruling class, which is white monopoly capital (WMC), didn’t rule for the last 350 years with hugs and kisses. It bribes. Those it can’t bribe, it kills. Let me say it again! You voted for Cyril Ramaphosa, a man bought by WMC. WMC will not let go of Ramaphosa without a bloody war. Even the cat knows it. We are not dealing with Atul Gupta here. We are dealing with Stephen Koseff. Kubi kubi kubi… Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First, a revolutionary black consciousness movement.
