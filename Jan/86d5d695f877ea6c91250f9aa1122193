By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published on the Black First Land First website and is now reissued by Black Opinion: Last night police stationed at the Orlando Police Station opened a criminal case against the attacker of Black First Land First (BLF) Deputy President, Comrade Zanele Lwana. The case number is CAS 287/1/2019. BLF is disappointed that the case was only opened after pressure was put on the police by the movement to do their work. BLF will lay a complaint with the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) in this regard. The conduct of the police is not conducive to fighting crime and serving the community. If the police had to be put under pressure before they acted in a case of a prominent leader, what more in the case of an ordinary citizen? BLF reiterates its belief that the attack on Comrade Lwana is part of a conspiracy to try and stop her from giving evidence to the Judicial Commission of Inquiry into State Capture (Zondo Commision). This evidence relates to the corruption at the National Treasury involving the disappearance of over R4.3 billion under the watch of Pravin Gordhan and Nhlanhla Nene as Ministers of Finance. Comrade Lwana is due to appear before the Zondo Commission on 12 February 2019. No amount of intimidation and dirty tactics will stop BLF from submitting evidence to Judge Zondo.
