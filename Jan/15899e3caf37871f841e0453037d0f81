By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published on the Black First Land First website and is now reissued by Black Opinion: BLF welcomes NPA withdrawal of charges against Duduzane Zuma Black First Land First (BLF) welcomes the withdrawal of charges against Duduzane Zuma by the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA). The charges relate to the fictitious account by Mcebisi Jonas, who claimed to have received a suitcase of R600 000 from Duduzane Zuma at the Gupta owned home in Saxonwold. BLF has long maintained that the state has no case, and that it is a fictitious creation by agents of white monopoly capital (WMC) to demonise the son of President Jacob Zuma, Duduzane, because they openly stood for Radical Economic Transformation (RET) and thus the end of white monopolisation of the economy. Important to remember, when Duduzane arrived back in South Africa to bury his brother, the Hawks humiliated him and acted as agents of Ramaphosa, putting him in leg irons, despite arriving independently in court. BLF calls on the NPA to formerly apologise for being used by WMC agent, Ramaphosa, to torment its political enemies. The NPA must be independent and needs to be seen as an institution that is free from this political interference. BLF is again vindicated. The case against the Guptas in relation to the Estina Dairy Farm was dropped. The case against Duduzane Zuma is now dropped. BLF will continue to stand with President Zuma, and is anticipating his case to also be dropped!
