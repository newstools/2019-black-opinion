By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published on the Black First Land First website and is now reissued by Black Opinion: It has come to our attention that some black people have staged violent protests against Prophet Shepherd Bushiri, also known as Major 1. Black First Land First (BLF) calls for peace amongst blacks and war against the enemy. The tragic death of three black people at the church must not be used by those who are in competition with Major 1 and by xenophobes for nefarious agendas. BLF calls on the police to do their work without fear or favour. At the same time we ask our people not to be used against Prophet Bushiri by people with evil agendas. We have never seen such violent actions waged against white Anglican, Catholic and Dutch churches. Despite the existence of irrefutable evidence of sexual violence perpetrated on innocent children and womenÂ by the clergy of the white churches, there is no outrage. Our people have freedom of religion and we must all respect that. Furthermore, BLF calls on Prophet Bushiri to fully cooperate with the police. We repeat, please stop the violence against fellow blacks and hands off Prophet Bushiri.
