By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published on the Black First Land First websiteÂ and is now reissued by Black Opinion: Black First Land First (BLF) condemns in the strongest possible terms the attack on its Deputy President in the early hours of Saturday. A stranger gained entry at the flat of the Deputy President of BLF around 2am on Saturday. The doors were locked. The stranger physically attacked the Deputy President comrade Zanele Lwana who fought the intruder back. During the scuffle other comrades woke up and the intruder fled with two phones including one of the Deputy President. The intruder tried to strangle the Deputy President, leaving her with an injured neck and bruises on her arms. BLF beliefs this was not a chance criminal act but a politically motivated act to try intimidate the Deputy President with the hope of making her back off from submitting evidence to the Zondo Commission on state capture. Comrade Zanele Lwana is due to give evidence to the Zondo Commission on the 12th of February 2019. What is sad is that the police who where called to the crime scene were totally unhelpful and refused to open a case. BLF will inform the commission about this attempt to intimidate the Deputy President of our movement. BLF warns all those implicated in corruption to now back off because nothing will stop the BLF from submitting evidence to judge Zondo.
