By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published on the Black First Land First website and is now reissued by Black Opinion: All the organizations of land thieves are celebrating the decision of the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC). They are scared of Black First Land First (BLF). They celebrate because they think they have silenced us. They think that BLF will not be registered as a political party to enable it to contest the elections and ensure that blacks are well represented everywhere, including in parliament and the municipalities. Their celebrations are premature, but revealing. They show that land thieves are scared of BLF. The land thieves are targeting BLF because they know only our movement can return the land and dignity of black people. We hereby assure black people and members of BLF that we shall fight until blacks get victory to organize without white interference and supervision. This is a fundamental right we are denied of. We call on blacks to join and support BLF. Whites have their FF+, let blacks have their BLF! BLF’s immediate actions are: 1. Study the decision of the IEC that set aside the registration of BLF as a political party.
2. Appeal to the Electoral Court against the IEC decision; and approach the Constitutional Court if necessary.
3. Prepare for the 2021 Local Government Elections. We must not allow these racists to demoralise and confuse the people. BLF is here to stay and fight! They can’t ban the revolution! Land or death! Issued by Black First Land First, National Coordinating Committee of (BLF NCC)
