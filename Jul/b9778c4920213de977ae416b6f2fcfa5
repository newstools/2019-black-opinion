By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published on the Black First Land First website and is now reissued by Black Opinion: Earlier today Black First Land First (BLF) applied to the Electoral Court in Bloemfontein for leave to appeal the unjust decision, dated 14 July 2019, of the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) which has effectively banned the movement. More specifically, the IEC had previously on the application of the Freedom Front Plus (FF+) set aside the decision of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) to register BLF as a political party. This is a banning order against BLF. BLF believes that should the Electoral Court grant us leave to appeal, strong prospects of success exist that the Court will ultimately overturn the decision of the IEC. We believe the IEC was bullied by the racist FF+ into banning our movement. The FF+ is terrified of BLF becuase it knows that we will ensure that land expropriation without compensation is a reality. BLF will take the fight right up to the Constitutional Court if needs be. We shall now await the directions of the Electoral Court.
