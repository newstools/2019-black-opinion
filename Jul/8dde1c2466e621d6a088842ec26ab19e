By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published on the Black First Land First website and is now reissued by Black Opinion: Black First Land First (BLF) welcomes the finding of not guilty of Duduzane Zuma on the charge of culpable homicide in the Randburg Magistrate’s Court, today The state did not prove that Duduzane Zuma, as the driver of a vehicle, had negligently caused the demise of Phumzile Dube. BLF maintains its condolences to the Dube family for the loss of their daughter due to injuries sustained in the motor vehicle collision that was the subject of the court case. The witch hunt against Duduzane must now come to an end. Ramaphosa has consistently used the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) to torment political enemies. In January this year, charges based on allegations by Mcebisi Jonas that he received a suitcase of R600 000 from Duduzane at the Gupta’s home were withdrawn by the NPA. The evidence was fabricated by white monopoly capital (WMC) agents to demonize him because he is the son of President Jacob Zuma and because of his stance in favour of Radical Economic Transformation (RET). We have also not forgotten how the Hawks humiliated Duduzane by shackling his legs when he arrived in South Africa to bury his brother. BLF is vindicated yet again. We have correctly stood in solidarity with Duduzane throughout his ordeal at the instance of the enemies of RET. BLF will continue to stand with President Zuma when he appears before the Zondo Commission next week. We are anticipating all criminal charges against him to ultimately also be dropped Issued by Black First Land First, National Coordinating Committee of (BLF NCC) 12 July 2019 Contact Details
