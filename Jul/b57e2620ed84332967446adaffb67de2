By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published on the Black First Land First website and is now reissued by Black Opinion: On 27 June 2019 the Pretoria High Court under case number 48064/18 ordered the blanket unblocking of the identity documents of millions of blacks at the instance of the government. First Land First (BLF), in solidarity with the plight of those affected, has undertaken to monitor the process. Yesterday leaders of Mahlo Ya Rixaka Community Project who represent the affected people and BLF leaders in Bushbuckridge Municipality welcomed receipt of the written Court judgement.  This will be circulated to members in Mpumalanga, Gauteng, Lipompo and North West to facilitate the speedy implementation of the court order.  The Court granted this order with costs against the Department of Home Affairs who had failed to demonstrate a just case for their heavy handedness. This is essentially a case of the theft of the identities of blacks by the anti black system. BLF, in consultation with the Mahlo Ya Rixaka Community Project, shall ensure that the Department of Home Affairs stops its racist conduct by: 1. actually unblocking of all black peopleâ€™s identity documents 2. desisting from conducting itself in the same manner again.  Further progress shall be reported in due course. Issued by Black First Land First, National Coordinating Committee of (BLF NCC) 7 July 2019 Black First Land First Email:blackfirstlandfirst@gmail.com
