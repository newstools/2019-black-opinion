By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published on the Black First Land First website and is now reissued by Black Opinion: Black First Land First (BLF) is: 1. the first political movement to be banned by democratic South Africa (SA).
2. the only ‘Blacks Only’ revolutionary movement in SA.
3. the only black organization which practises the doctrine “peace amongst blacks”, which manifests as “defend all blacks under attack from white supremacy without asking questions” (see the BLF ‘Black Code on Sellouts’).
4. the only movement which has come out and defended President Jacob Zuma when white monopoly capital (WMC) and imperialism attacked him.
5. the only political movement which has consistently taken the fight to the real enemy which is WMC (including the Oppenheimers and Ruperts).
6. the only organization that has warned that the February 2018 parliamentary motion on land expropriation without compensation (LEWC) was a fraud to delay land return.
7. the only political movement whose votes were systematically stolen in the 2019 elections (the enemy does not want BLF in parliament).
8. the only organization which opposes competition amongst black political parties, hence its adoption of Radical Economic Transformation (RET) despite it being an African National Congress (ANC) Nasrec Elective Conference policy (which has been abandoned by the Cyril Ramaphosa leadership).
9. the only movement which shall never collaborate with land thieves against any black person.
10. the only organization that land thieves don’t want to exists.
