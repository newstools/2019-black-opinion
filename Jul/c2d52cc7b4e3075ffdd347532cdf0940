By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published on the Black First Land First website and is now reissued by Black Opinion: Black First Land First (BLF) calls for President Cyril Ramaphosa to step down. The findings of the Public Protector are damning and the President must do the right thing and step down with immidiate effect. BLF welcomes the findings of the Public Protector on the Bosasa lies. Ramaphosa used money obtained through corrupt ways to buy the African National Congress (ANC) elective conference of December 2017 so as to emerge as the President. This means his Presidency was obtained through unlawful actions. Ramaphosa lied to parliament to conceal the unlawful acts associated with his campaign sponsored by white monopoly capital (WMC). BLF will also write to the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) to ask for progress on the criminal charges that were laid by us on 7 February 2019 against Ramaphosa at the Cape Town Central Police Station under case no 342/2/2019, for corruption; bribery; fraud; money laundering; and tax evasion regarding the Bosasa saga. Ramaphosa must go! Issued by Black First Land First, National Coordinating Committee of (BLF NCC)
