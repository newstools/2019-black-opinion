By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published on the Black First Land First website and is now reissued by Black Opinion: In pursuit of the unity of black people and their organizations Black First Land First (BLF) will not hold a separate event to commemorate the June 16, 1976 Black Power uprising. For far too long black organizations have allowed disunity to dictate even how we remember important days in the calendar of black liberation. BLF has written to the older Black Consciousness (BC) organizations and engaged them on this matter. We call on our members to commemorate the event with BC organizations such as the Azania Peopleâ€™s Organization (AZAPO) and the Socialist Party of Azania (SOPA). We hope unity may come soon enough. BLF shall take the same attitude on Sharpeville Day, which is correctly a day whose commemoration must be led by the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC). Black unity in struggle is difficult to achieve, but we must struggle to do so. We remember June 16; 1976 uprising! Lets commemorate for black unity in struggle. Issued by the National Coordinating Committee of Black First Land First 15 June 2019
