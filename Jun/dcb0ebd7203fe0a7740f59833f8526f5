By BO Staff Writer The following statement was issued today by Vukani Community DevelopmentÂ and is now reissued by Black Opinion: Vukani Community Development (Vukani) is a newly registered Non Profit Organization (NPO) which is formed to support the organizations of black people and the Black Community. Vukani is pleased to announce that the great grandson of the late former President Nelson Mandela is the elected chairperson of the NPO. Vukani is established to raise funds for pro black poltical parties such as Black First Land First (BLF) and to fund developmental projects in the black community. Vukani shall also contribute to the financing of the BLF Private Litigation Unit to defend black people. In the 2019 National General Elections white monopoly capital funded its parties with billions of rands. Pro black poltical parties, such as BLF, were not funded at all. Vukani is established with the blessings of BLF to remedy this situation. White people fund organizations to advance their interests. Vukani is the answer for black people. The black revolution must be funded by black people themselves. It can be done! Vukani calls upon all black people to support its mission of funding the struggle for black liberation by making donations into its bank account. Regular reports will be made to those who make donations. You may donate by making a direct deposit into the following bank account: Bank: First National Bank
