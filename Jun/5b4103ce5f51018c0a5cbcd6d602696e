By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published on the Black First Land First website and is now reissued by Black Opinion: First Land First (BLF) was in the High Court today, supporting millions of people in Mpumalanga whose identity documents had been blocked by the government, in the following matter: Mahlo Ya Rixaka Community Project (Applicant) versus Minister of the Department of Home Affairs (First Respondent); and Director-General: Department of Home Affairs (Second Respondent), in the High Court, Gauteng Division, sitting in Pretoria, case number 48064/18 The government, which has been allowed to act with impunity, had blocked the identity documents of blacks in their multitudes for no stated reason. This act of identity theft generally serves to keep blacks in bondage and gives legitimacy to colonial land theft and the destruction of the African being. BLF congratulates Mahlo Ya Rixaka Community Project for leading the struggle to return the identities of countless blacks who have been robbed of their identities at the instance of the anti black government. The High Court today correctly ordered the unblocking of the relevant identity documents, with costs against the Department of Home Affairs â€“ who had failed to answer to the case against them. This signals a stunning victory for the people! BLF shall monitor the implementation of the court order in terms of which the Department of Home Affairs has seven days from today to effect the necessary unblocking.
