By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published on the Black First Land First website and is now reissued by Black Opinion: The Black First Land First (BLF) Twitter account has been hacked and an unauthorized statement was published this morning via that account. The hackers still have access to the account and appropriate steps are currently being taken to correct this situation. The statement published through the account purports to be from the suspended Secretary General of BLF, who is facing numerous serious charges by the movement. He has even been granted an extension of time by the Disciplinary Committee to respond to the charges against him. There is obviously no truth in the silly allegation that the President of BLF is not a member of a movement he leads. The Presidentâ€™s membership is valid until 2020. The Central Committee (CC) and National Coordinating Committee (NCC) have full confidence in the President of BLF. The BLF President appointed the SG just over a year ago after he was fired by the First National Bank. BLF provided support for his plight and embraced him at the most difficult time in his life. Steps are being taken to strengthen BLF after the general elections and some deadwood will naturally resist any rectification and cleaning up process. BLF has full confidence in the integrity of the process set in motion.
