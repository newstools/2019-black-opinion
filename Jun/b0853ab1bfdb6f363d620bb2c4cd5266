By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published on the Black First Land First website and is now reissued by Black Opinion: The homeless of Tshwane, who have been murdered in their sleep, are in an even bigger danger now. AfriForum, which is known to defend white farmers who murder innocent black people, is providing a visibility patrol service following the recent murders of homeless people. This could be a cover for the serial killer or killers to murder more unsuspecting homeless people. Black First Land First (BLF) calls on the homeless not to be lulled into complacency because of the presence of AfriForum amongst them at night. BLF will write to the Minister of Police to ask for his intervention to stop AfriForum, who are known defenders of convicted murderers of black people, from creating conducive conditions for serial killers to operate undercover. If the Minister fails to intervene BLF will ask its security arm, Bambathaâ€™s Shield, to monitor the AfriForum patrollers. We cannot allow known racists and defenders of murderers free reign over the vulnerable.
