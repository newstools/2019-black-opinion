By BO Staff Writer Yesterday, the leadership of the Black First Land First (BLF) movement met President Jacob Zuma to thank him for his contributions to the struggle and in the formation of Radical Economic Transformation (RET). The black consciousness organisation presented President Zuma with a shield which they deem “a symbolic representation of the defense of RET and an attack on White Monopoly Capital (WMC)”. The shield further represents “a commitment by BLF to continue the fight for RET and a call on President Zuma to do likewise”, the movement said in a statement this morning. Read the full statement below: Black First Land First (BLF) wishes to thank the Zuma family for opening up their home to the BLF leadership and granting BLF the opportunity to personally thank President Zuma for Radical Economic Transformation (RET). BLF President, Andile Mngxitama, gifted a shield on behalf of the revolutionary movement to President Zuma, which is a symbolic representation of the defense of RET and an attack on White Monopoly Capital (WMC). It further exemplifies a commitment by BLF to continue the fight for RET and a call on President Zuma to do likewise. President Zuma also took time to answer a number of questions posed by BLF and has also promised to look into the idea of a ‘Jacob Zuma Institute for Strategy and Tactics’. Finally, BLF wishes to reiterate that we remain the only option to defend RET in a parliament captured by white monopoly and thus call on all who want RET and love the father of RET, President Jacob Zuma, to take BLF to parliament by voting BLF on the 8th of May, 2019. #DefendRET
