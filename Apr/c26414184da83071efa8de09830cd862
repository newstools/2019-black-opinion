By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published on the Black First Land First website and is now reissued by Black Opinion: The racist representatives of land thieves who want a boerestaad, Freedom Front Plus (FF+), have suffered yet another knockout from the black power fists of Black First Land First (BLF). Last week the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) dismissed yet another attempt by the FF+ to stop BLF from contesting the elections. The IEC ruled against the grossly out of time appeal against the registration of BLF. FF+ panicked a whole two years and nine months later when it saw that BLF is going to parliament. The knockout suffered by the terrified land thieves came when they ran away from the high court and withdrew their application when it was set for arguments. The land thieves with their tails behind their legs quietly appealed to the IEC when they realised they were going to lose badly in court. The IEC also dismissed their silly appeal. It is two for BLF and zero for land thieves. BLF is ready to serve in parliament and no land thieves can stop us. The terrified land thieves are now back at the Electoral Court they had ran away from in the first place. They will again lose and it will be a 3 – 0 defeat. We are looking forward to yet another defeat of land thieves. #TakeBLFtoParliament Issued by the National Coordinating Committee of Black First Land First (BLF – NCC) 13 April 2019 Zanele Lwana
