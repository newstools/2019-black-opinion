By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published on the Black First Land First website and is now reissued by Black Opinion: The Electoral Court has yesterday given further directions in the matter under application number 001/19 by the racist Freedom Front Plus (FF+) to have Black First Land First (BLF) banned from the 2019 national elections. The Court has directed the parties to submit their heads of argument and FF+ to in addition index the papers by next week Tuesday. It has further directed that the matter shall be heard on Thursday the 4th of April 2019 at the Johannesburg High Court. FF+, like all land thieves, is terrified of BLF going to parliament and has decided to hide behind the courts. BLF is an unapologetically BLACKS ONLY organization and is prepared to defend the right of black people to fight for their liberation by any means necessary. BLF is more than ready to meet the racist FF+ in court and to defeat it. Nothing will stop BLF from going to parliament. The African National Congress (ANC) of Cyril Ramaphosa and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) have sold black people out. The two parties refused to use their two thirds majority to amend the constitution to realise land expropriation without compensation. FF+ knows that BLF shall never sell black people out. BLF is ready to meet FF+ in court next Thursday. We are going to defeat the racists in their own court. Issued by the National Coordinating Committee of Black First Land First (BLF â€“ NCC)
