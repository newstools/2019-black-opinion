By Andile Mngxitama Today was boss. Ok that was so after we “bullied” court to be fair. Can you imagine the Judge who hates Black First Land First (BLF) and had written a horrible judgement against us, had to hold up his own judgement which he altered with his inscription “this judgement is a nullity”? I’m suppressing my laughter. I’m thinking, “we got you motherfuckers!!!“ We literally snatched victory from the jaws of defeat. Viva BLF!
