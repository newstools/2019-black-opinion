Photo credit: defenceWeb By Andile Mngxitama Is this normal? The 19 R4 assault rifles stolen from the Lyttelton Tek military base near Pretoria base are not yet recovered. And do you realize that we donâ€™t know the identities of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) members accused of the theft of the weapons? Even the race or gender of each of those accused have not been revealed. Cyril Ramaphosa must stop acting secretively. His clandestine behavior regarding this issue suggests a massive cover-up of those compromising the territorial integrity and national security of the country. The nation must know who the accused persons are. And we hear that a white Military Judge presided in this case during the last court appearance of those accused. We are not all stupid. This thing smells of a massive cover-up. So who stole the 19 R4 assault rifles? Why are their identities hidden? Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization. No related posts.
