By Andile Mngxitama If you think that the Democratic Alliance (DA) is worried about the Metropolitan Municipalities (metros), it’s because you haven’t yet figured out that it is running South Africa (SA) via Stellenbosch money. It is clear that Cyril Ramaphosa is the President of the DA. The fact that parliament had passed rules to remove the Public Protector; and South African Airways (SAA) is under business rescue and in the hands of white monopoly capital (WMC) – is evidence of this. The party of the Red Berets, that gave power to the DA because it regarded it as the “better devils” in relation to the African National Congress (ANC), has been shut down by its corruption driven by its love for Louis Vuittons and Range Rovers. It has been rendered irrelevant. The “better devils” are ruling you, wena you are busy saying that they are losing metros. One day I will write about why the DA doesn’t need to contest elections. It can always rule via the ANC like it is doing now. All the DA needs to do is to ensure that the ANC conferences are bought, then walla!!! The sad thing is that black people think they are voting for the ANC when they are voting for the DA. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization. No related posts.
