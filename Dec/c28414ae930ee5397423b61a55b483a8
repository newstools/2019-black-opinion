Image credit: Gallo Images By BO Staff Writer The following statement, which was issued by Black First Land First today, is now published by Black Opinion: Black First Land First (BLF) condemns the robbery that took place this week at the Engineering Formation located in the Lyttelton Tek Base of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) in Pretoria, where at least 20 fully automatic R4 rifles were stolen from an ammunitions store. BLF believes that there is a connection between the theft of arms and the multiple right wing militias which our government has allowed under the guise of self defence by land thieves. Itâ€™s shocking that the government allows whites to have private armies which are openly preparing for war against black people. We also believe that the government of Cyril Ramaphosa has surrendered the SANDF, just like it did with other state owned entities (SOEs), to white monopoly capital (WMC). When Johann Rupert said he has a private army in the taxi industry, no one took notice of this except BLF. These arms will end up in private armies to harm black people. BLF calls on black people to equally prepare to defend themselves against these land thieves Issued by Black First Land First, National Coordinating Committee of (BLF NCC) 26 December 2019 Contact Details Black First Land First Mail: blackfirstlandfirst@gmail.com Zanele Lwana
