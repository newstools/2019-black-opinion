By BO Staff Writer A University of Cape Town (UCT) survey concerning sexual victimisation in South Africa (SA) indicates that one out of three boys is likely to be abused sexually before he reaches the age of eighteen. The same has reportedly been said about girls. This suggests a reconceptualization of gender based violence so that men are recognized as victims of this violence. Thus far the focus regarding sexual abuse has been on the girl child and women in general. The boy child and men have been neglected. Andile Mngxitama, the President of the black consciousness organization Black First Land First (BLF), took to social media on this issue. “We have been saying the UCT/WITS/Rhodes feminism doesnt get it. You will be shocked by the levels of participation of women in the abuse and murder of children. The moralist anti men approach to understanding and addressing the problem is going to catch up with its proponents”, he said. No related posts.
