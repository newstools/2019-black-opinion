At this point, I don’t believe we need a new political party – rather, a movement of South Africans who believe in the same values and want to build on those values. … That’s what I’m focusing on. Party number 49 in the line of parties is not going to do the country much good”, Maimane reportedly said. Responding to claims that they don’t intend to form a political party, Black First Land First President, Andile Mngxitama, said that the contrary is true: “No, they certainly will form a political party. After their “consultations” with the public, they will say that the people said they must form a party”, he said. The announcement of the launch of a new “movement” follows Maimane’s return on Saturday from a visit to the imperialist countries, UK and US, where he addressed many conferences. “Mashaba and Mmusi are forming a new Right Wing political party approved, if not funded, by London and Washington D.C. They had to go to the Queen and the CIA to get their mandate and advice. They will launch a political party for 2021. They will moreover use xenophobia as their platform to power. Capital will love them but it doesn’t need them. It has Cyril Ramaphosa. So we shall see”, Mngxitama clarified. No related posts.
