By Andile Mngxitama For me, the biggest story broken by the media in 2019 was the Sunday Independent report on how Cyril Ramaphosa got R1 billion from white monopoly capital (WMC) to influence the African National Congress (ANC) Nasrec conference held in December 2019. The Sunday Independent even gave us names of those who bought Ramaphosa and how much they each sponsored his CR17 election campaign. Of course, we know that the R1 billion was used to buy the Nasrec conference and to this end a President for the country to serve WMC.. The story titled “How the CR17 campaign funds were channelled“, was written by Piet Rampedi, Mzilikazi Wa Afrika, and Karabo Ngoepe. It was published on 11 August 2019 and may be accessed via the link, https://www.iol.co.za/sundayindependent/news/how-the-cr17-campaign-funds-were-channelled-30641667 I don’t think there is a bigger story. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization. No related posts.
