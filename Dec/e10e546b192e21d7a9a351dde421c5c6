By Andile Mngxitama It’s that time of the year when the real South Africa presents itself. Whites go on holiday. Blacks go home. Joburg is empty… It’s that time when politicians become Santa Clause and dish out goodies to the poor from money looted from the same poor. It’s disgusting! Yes, while you are busy with wors in Dezemba boss, Stellenbosch is busy braaing the Eskom power stations and other SOEs. In the meantime I can’t help noticing that the “woke” behave exactly like religious fundamentalists. Their intolerance is intolerable. I would have thought the “enlightened” would show understanding and patience instead of being the Taliban. Merry Xmas!
