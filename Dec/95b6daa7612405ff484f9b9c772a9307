By Andile Mngxitama 2019 will certainly go down as the year that white supremacy embraced blackness as it’s shield so as to continue the oppression of black people the world over, wrapped as a great advancement of blackness. We blacks celebrate our oppression which is presented to us by white supremacy as the recognition of black beauty and black excellence. Oppression has just gone super sophisticated. But of course, it still has bullets if soft power doesn’t work. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization. No related posts.
