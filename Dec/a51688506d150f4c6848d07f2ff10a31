By Andile Mngxitama Black First Land First (BLF) is the intellectual and ideological vanguard of the people. This is because we follow Black Consciousness (BC). We lead South Africa (SA) in radical thought and are consistent. We do not flip flop! We don’t sellout! The future belongs to the radical black nationalism of BLF. The enemy knows this. That’s why it has banned our movement and is funding pseudo revolutionary groups. Every direction we give on any national matter is correct because it puts blacks first. Others opportunistically copy us. We understand. We are 100 years ahead! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
