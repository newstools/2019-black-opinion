By Andile Mngxitama If Black First Land First (BLF) is so irrelevant why are we the only organization whose voices scares the enemy so much? The official website of BLF has been shut down after another cyber terrorist attack. The most trusted online publication by serious black people, the Black Opinion, has also been brought down by the cyber terrorist onslaught! They can’t stop an idea whose time has come. They fear because they can’t buy or blackmail us. Andile Mngxitama, the President of Black First Land First (BLF) (a radical black consciousness organization) posted the above message on social media on 17 December 2019. No related posts.
