By Andile Mngxitama Recently I concocted the notion of “accumulation by crisis”. Capital expansion happens better under conditions of crises which in turn gives it dominion over spaces initially considered for public good or the commons or basic needs. The Eskom crisis is good for white monopoly capital (WMC) but bad for the people. The irony of this situation is that the people voted for the authors of this pro WMC crisis.
