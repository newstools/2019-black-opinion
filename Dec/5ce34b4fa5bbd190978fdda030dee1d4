By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published on the Black First Land First website: Today we remember the Ncome river African martyrs whose supreme sacrifices in defence of our land has been betrayed by the overzealous cowardice of the African National Congress (ANC). In 1995 the ruling party chose to erase the patriotic courage of the warriors by naming the Ncome war, the
Day of Reconciliation. This was a slap on the face of our martyrs. There’s no reconciliation without justice. The Ncome river ranks high in the annals of black resistance. Our blood flowed for our land. The invading criminals who made war to rob us of our land have now been given the right over our land. That’s why the 1994 constitution gives property protection to land robbers. The Ncome warriors were not just betrayed by the ruling party in 1995, the betrayal continues. Black parties betray these warriors when they march hand in hand with land thieves against Jacob Zuma. They betray these martyrs when they give political power to the same mass murderers and call them the “better devil”. The betrayal of Ncome has now become a collective insult thrown from parliament by parties bought by the beneficiaries of blood river war. There shall be no land expropriation without compensation despite talks and intrigues in this regard. BLF recognizes this day as one of those events where our people stood firm and gave meaning to the adage “land or death”. We commit to never forget and to never betray. The 3000 warriors whose blood flowed for land are not dead. They shall rise as one in us and claim the stolen land!
