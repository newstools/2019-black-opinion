By Andile Mngxitama Please do not drag me into your tribalist bullshit. Yesterday we were commemorating the 3000 African warriors who paid supremely for the land. Wena, narrow tribal bullshitters tell us your tribe contributed more than Dingane with the frontier battles. You always erase the contributions of Africans who aren’t of your tribe, to validate the nonsensical idea of your exceptionalism. Fuck off! Yesterday was about Dingane the Great! You hate that because he was not from your tribe? Go to hell! We aren’t in competition here. This shit is tiring!
