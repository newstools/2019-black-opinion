By Andile Mngxitama I now think that our political leaders go to Stellenbosch to be used as sex objects by those white monopoly capital (WMC) rulers. They then come and mimic their bosses using black boys. Frantz Fanon speaks about the comprador as imitators of the colonial ruling class. This sexual behavior pattern isn’t black. So where did they get it from? Our leaders are hallowed out by white power. It’s sick and scary! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization. No related posts.
