By BO Staff Writer Black First Land First (BLF) President, Andile Mngxitama, has accused the top leadership of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) of copying the writings and other material of his movement. ”The Reds of London regularly plagiarize BLF material. Its no longer funny. They steal BLF positions day light”, Mngxitama said. He referred to a recent case in point which concerns his address at the BLF’s Special Policy Conference (SPC), which was held on 30 November 2019 in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal. The SPC was convened to chart the road ahead for the movement which had been deregistered – on the instruction of the racist whites only Freedom Front Plus (FF+) – by the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC). Mngxitama referenced the following clarifying remarks he made in his address to the SPC: “Lets tell black people something they don’t know: ALL BLACK PEOPLE ARE MEMBERS OF BLF! In the same way, all white people are members of FF+. Scratch the skin of any white person, underneath you will find FF+; scratch the skin of any black person, you will find BLF beneath”. To expound on EFF’s plagiarism Mngxitama then compared his message with that tweeted by EFF heavyweight Dali Mpofu (via his Twitter account @AdvDali_Mpofu) a day ago: “There’s a hidden EFF inside EVERY black person … Even @MmusiMsimane”. The rest of Mpofu‘s message is likewise plagiarized from the BLF President’s  “It’s ok. We are ahead and the Mazzotti boys follow… They must just abandon London and their love for the Louis Vuitton and Range Rover lifestyle… They must stop the dinners with Johann Rupert”, Mngxitama said in closing.
