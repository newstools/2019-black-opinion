There is also some truth in that statement because if we had been victorious, no one would call the Public Protector, Busisiwe Mkhwebane, a “saboteur-in-chief” as Ferial Haffajee has done in the piece from which I quote her: “Mkhwebane is now clearly aligned to a faction of ANC politics and to the patronage network arranged around Zuma. She first unsheathed her sword in 2016, taking up a Black First Land First (BLF) campaign to use her power to investigate the Bankorp bailout by the central bank between 1985 and 1992. The BLF, a failed civic movement started when its founder Andile Mngxitama quit the EFF and needed a home, morphed into an organisation of Gupta-family sponsored provocateurs. It is now aligned to Zuma and is part of the motley crew who support him at court cases and also did so at his appearance at the Zondo Commission of Inquiry in July. Even though Judge Dennis Davis had investigated and found that the ultimate claimants for the bailout paid would be pensioners, and the ANC had decided to let it go, Mkhwebane found that Absa (founded from a merger of banks including Bankorp) had to repay R1.2-billion” – Haffajee in “Saboteur-in-chief – Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane: Meng Xi goes Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon”, published in Daily Maverick on 19 December 2019).

It’s not a battle. And history has not ended. In 2020 we (BLF) are going back to ABSA, Johann Rupert and others who looted billions from the South African Reserve Bank (SARB). We are not Louis Vuitton addicts. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization. No related posts.
