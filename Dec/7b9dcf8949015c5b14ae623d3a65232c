Photo credit: Kayleen Morgan/EWN By Andile Mngxitama The opinion piece by Jyothi Maharaj , titled “LETTER: It is amazing how the EFF and BLF agree on this Ramaphosa issue” which was published by Independent Online (IOL) on 20 December 2019, alleges a convergence which doesn’t exist. Black First Land First (BLF) has maintained this position of rejecting Ramaphosa’s “New Dawn” while the EFF has been giving Cyril Ramaphosa standing ovations on the issue. Who called Cyril “our President” at the funeral of Mme Winnie!? The writer of the piece suffers from the basic South African problem of not addressing the why question. When Julius Malema, at the EFF’s recent elective conference said that Ramaphosa is captured by white monopoly capital, he should have been asked: Why now? What has changed?
