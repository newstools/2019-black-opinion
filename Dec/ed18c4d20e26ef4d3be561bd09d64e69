By Andile Mngxitama “Next year we will occupy ABSA”, said the EFF leadership in 2015. In 2016 we asked “en nou?“ They said they are waiting for the announcement of the repo rate. I fell from my chair with laughter. It’s now the end of 2019. Dololo ABSA occupation. They are only occupying the money of the poor at VBS. “We are going to occupy the private international airport of the Oppenheimers”, they declared. Oh well, Fireblade is still trading nicely. When the Oppenheimers went to parliament the chaps ran away. BLF had to deal with the matter. Now that the Mazzotti boys are in trouble again with their white monopoly capital friends, they are threatening that they will be fighting the “financial sector”. Actually, with one call from Robin Renwick or Johann Rupert it will be game over. These guys know that people who follow them are stupid. If you believe a word of these Mazzotti boys, you are a fool! I’m sorry, there is no other way to think of this… Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization. No related posts.
