By Andile Mngxitama Here are three thoughts for consideration today: 1. Load-shedding is a deliberate project of monopoly capital (WMC) to sell Eskom.
2. Marijuana/zol was demonized by WMC until they could commercialize it for themselves.
3. “Black beauty” is the next big commercial product for the accumulation of profits by the global white power structure. Have a good day… Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization. No related posts.
