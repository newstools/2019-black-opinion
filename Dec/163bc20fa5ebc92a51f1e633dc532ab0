Bantu Holomisa, the United Democratic Movement (UDM) leader, tweeted that his party’s mayor was removed because he didn’t approve favors “demanded by some political party members”.  He also confirmed on Twitter that Bobani is challenging the decision to oust him as mayor on the basis that he was removed through a violation of procedures. “How do u remove a mayor on a motion which is not even on the Agenda”, Holomisa asked.  The ANC supported the DA’s motion and the EFF abstained from it. Bobani has reportedly said before his removal as mayor that the ANC and EFF wanted him gone because he refused to approve their dishonest deals. To this end Luyolo Nqakula, the co-ordinator of the ANC regional task team, had requested his assistance to secure the NMB’s new contract on pauper burials. Andile Mngxitama, the President of Black First Land First (BLF) which is a radical black consciousness organization, also took to social media on this issue. “There is one party in SA (the DA) but it comes in different colours. Its a gemors…”, he said sharply. No related posts.
