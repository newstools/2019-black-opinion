Delegates at the EFF’s elective conference at Nasrec, Joburg. Image: EFF/Twitter By BO Staff Writer EFF delegates knelt before Julius Malema while praising him in song after he delivered his keynote address at the elective conference at Nasrec in Johannesburg on Saturday. Many including the Black First Land First President Andile Mngxitama, saw this as Malema’s cult of personality. “If they knelt it’s because the fuhrer had planned it. The guy understands the acoustic of power. From blue-light protection to kneeling before the King …
It’s a cult proper…”
It’s no wonder that he was re-elected unopposed and his slate won uncontested. Many also say that his personality cult is generally in service of white monopoly capital (Stellenbosch) who had sponsored the conference to the tune of over R32 million. So Malema didn’t disappoint his sponsors and Johann Rupert is happy. Here’s the Stellenbosch top 6: President, Julius Malema: his nomination met the threshold of 30% support; it was unopposed. Deputy President, Floyd Shivambu: his nomination met the required threshold; it was opposed by Dali Mpofu who didn’t meet the threshold National Chairperson, Veronica Mente: her nomination met the threshold; Dali Mpofu was also nominated but he declined. Secretary general, Marshall Dlamini: his nomination met the threshold; it was opposed by Mandisa Mashego who didn’t meet the threshold; Collin Shai was also nominated but he declined. Deputy Secretary general, Poppy Mailola: her nomination met the threshold; Hlengiwe Mkhalipi was also nominated but she declined. Treasurer general, Omphilo Maotwe: Maotwe’s nomination had met the threshold; the nomination was unopposed.  No related posts.
