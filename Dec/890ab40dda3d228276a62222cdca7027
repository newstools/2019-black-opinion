Image credit: African News Agency (ANA) By Andile Mngxitama The EFF leadership are now destroying some really principled comrades. Firstly, we know that Comrade (Cde) Mandisa Makesini can’t write anything, including a report. Now the Mazzotti boys are forcing Cde Piaba Madokwe to lie and contradict herself because of her previous proximity to us organisationally. Please someone, quietly tell Cde Piaba that I, Andile Mngxitama, wrote the ENTIRE Marxist Leninist Fanonian ideological framework of the EFF. Also the Mazzotti boys must stop embarrassing her. Once you say Frantz Fanon, you say BLACK CONSCIOUSNESS. We, as the September National Imbizo (SNI) at that time, brought Fanon in to express our Black Consciousness. We understood the limitations of Marxism-Leninism. In fact we toyed with the possibility of the triad of Marxist-Leninist-Sankarist, but we settled on the current triad of
Marxist-Leninist-Fanonist which has been abandoned by the EFF leadership for the Louis Vuitton lifestyle. Floyd Shivambu writing the article “Each generation must choose its mission” (which was published yesterday on the EFF website) as Mandisa Makesini, is lying openly when he says EFF was never committed to the SANKARA OATH. The EFF Founding Manifesto, which included the SANKARA OATH, was adopted at the founding policy conference. Floyd removed the Oath illegally as soon as money started rolling in – they wanted their Porsche Cayenne cars and other trinkets of consumption. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization. No related posts.
