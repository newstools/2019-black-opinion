By Andile Mngxitama Black First Land First (BLF) is the future of black people. We are just warming up. We had a successful Special Policy Conference on Saturday. Today we beat the land thieves (Solidarity) at their own game in the South Gauteng High Court regarding the hate speech complaint they lodged against us. Black people want BLF everywhere. Some thought that BLF is dependent on them. No, they were wrong! This thing is bigger than the individual. No one is bigger than the movement, not a single person… We received hundreds of requests to join and build BLF. We shall be sharing our guidelines to assist and facilitate the processes in this regard – wherever you are. Do not ask when is BLF coming to your area? Ask what can I do to build BLF in my area. You ARE BLF! Land or Death! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization. No related posts.
