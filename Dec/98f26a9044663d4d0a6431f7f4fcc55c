By Andile Mngxitama Most loud English speaking black youth on social media have been systematically rendered stupid by the media and the educational system including that of the universities. They really don’t have the capacity to differentiate between what is fact and what is propaganda. So these people, who consider themselves clever, can’t even understand what’s wrong with privatization. They honestly think that it’s about rescuing the state owned enterprises (SOEs). They have no capacity to make the connection between white monopoly capital (WMC) sponsoring Cyril Ramaphosa R1 billion to buy the African National Congress (ANC) Nasrec conference in December 2017 and the selling of SOEs to the same sponsors of the CR17 campaign. The truth is that we aren’t going to win this war with so many victims of white propaganda. That’s why the Special Policy Conference of Black First Land First (BLF), held at the end of a November this year, has declared 2020 the year of awakening and organizing. Thats why in 2020 we will intensify education. As part of the education process, I will be bringing out a brand new YouTube channel. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization. No related posts.
