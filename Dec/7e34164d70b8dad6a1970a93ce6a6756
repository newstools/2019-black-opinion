By Andile Mngxitama Is this message from the Twitter account of Floyd Shivambu, Johann Rupert’s political advisor, or is it a parody account?  Even the red right wing can’t openly praise the colonialist plunder and spiritual violence brought to bear upon black people so openly. I’m having a hard time recovering from Shivambu paying tribute to the white missionary, Reinhard Bonnke, for “saving souls” in Africa. The Mazzotti boys are just plain flatfooted opportunists. They have no ideology despite calling themselves Marxist Leninists – and they have long forgotten Fanon. I still hope this was a sort of a joke. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization. No related posts.
