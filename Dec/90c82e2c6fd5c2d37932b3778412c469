Taking to social media, Andile Mngxitama, the President of Black First Land First (BLF), remarked: “One way to bribe delegates in a conference is to give them “VIP treatment” and they will know which slate will provide the vacation. These assemblies are rigged from start to end. White monopoly capital (WMC) gave Cyril Ramaphosa a whole R1 billion to buy the ANC elective conference, Nasrec 1. Politics in SA is controlled by money. I wonder how much Stellenbosch has really coughed up for the EFF’s NPA, Nasrec 2. Over R32 million has already been declared”. About 4000 delegates mainly from the Limpopo, Gauteng and Mpumalanga are said to be attending this elective conference. “Check this, R32 million divided by 4000 delegates = R8000 per delegate. Think my people, think”, Mngxitama said. No related posts.
