By Andile Mngxitama The rigging and systemic corruption is not a joke. Stellenbosch’s R32 million translating to R8000 per delegate coming from shacks, did the job at EFF’s elective conference, Nasrec 2. There is no socialism. Clearly, Rupert is in charge… No one dares to vote against Julius. Those who voted for Dali Mpofu are on video. They are gone! But please save this update, “in two years or so Dali will return at the highest position in that party”. Watch!!! In a party controlled by a cult figure elections by a show of hands is completely devoid of democratic choice. Imagine members of Adolf Hitler’s party voting against the wishes of the Fuhrer? Imagine the EFF with real state power, singanya straight…. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization. No related posts.
