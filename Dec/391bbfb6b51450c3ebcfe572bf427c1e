The Chairperson of Vukani Community Development and great grandson of Nelson Mandela, calls on all patriots, African royalty, faith based organizations, pro black civil society organisations, and political parties not captured by the enemy through money, to convene a national summit to defend the wealth of the nation and end the privatization of the South African Airways (SAA). Cyril Ramaphosa is giving away the assets of the state to his friends and sponsors. This must not be allowed. After they are finished with the South African Airways (SAA) they will go to all the other strategic assets. By the time they are done, SAA will be a privately owned entity completely. Thatâ€™s not what those who sacrificed for the liberation of South Africa suffered so much for. We must defend the legacy of the liberation movement and say no to privatisation.
