By Andile Mngxitama Before you celebrate your oppression presented to you as acknowledgement of black beauty and black excellence, ask yourself this: who curated this symbolic act of black embrace and for what? The white system has decided that symbolic “decolonization” is the new instrument of white power. Decolonization has been colonized! I refuse to celebrate. I critically analyze. So too, should you. It’s permitted empty resistance for the recuperation of white power. This is what it‘s about! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization. No related posts.
