By Andile Mngxitama Did you know that Eskom under the incompetents is applying to the court to basically double what we are paying for energy in two years? This is clearly meant to harass us with load-shedding and high tariffs until we surrender the state owned enterprises (SOEs) to those who gave Cyril Ramaphosa R1 billion to buy the African National Congress (ANC) Nasrec conference. By the way, Black First Land First (BLF) has laid criminal charges of corruption, bribery, fraud, money laundering, and tax evasion against Ramaphosa for his conduct. Of course the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has not done anything about this. The truth is, there is no compelling reason why we can’t get free electricity for household consumption in South Africa (SA). Here’s six reasons why electricity should be free: 1. National household consumption is less than 30% of the total consumption.
2. Coal is the biggest source of electricity – 90% of electricity is generated from coal.
3. Coal is free – it’s a gift of nature.
4. To sink and establish a mine, Eskom gives white monopoly capital (WMC) money (cost plus the mine).
5. Eskom then gives that mine it has just paid WMC to establish, a long term contract which is often prepaid for up to 40 years. In other words, Eskom pays WMC to build a mine and then buys coal from the same mine.
6. Coal is free, yet the mine taking it out of the ground is paid for the same coal by the State. It follows that we must not buy electricity from free coal and state built mines. Remember electricity is a basic right! That’s why the privatization of Eskom is such a cruel evil thing!
