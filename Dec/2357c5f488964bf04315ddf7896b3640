By Andile Mngxitama Ladies and gentlemen, I understand those who hijacked the arms at the SA Army base earlier this week are appearing in court. Again we hear from third parties. The government is not interested. I think the government of Cyril Ramaphosa is busy with a cover-up. Those arrested are artificial lambs. Johann Rupert may be arming his private militias. On other news, the other day I finally got to listen to Ntencane. I will take Master KG‘s Jerusalema torture any day. We now must elevate stuff from that genre. I must give Jerusalema another listening session though and try to understand its attraction. On second take, it seems to me that the song is much more subliminal than the expected festive high tempo stuff. Plus I understand it’s about lost love, so the verdict ain’t out yet. I mean, killing van Damme was a killer but still my judgment can’t be trusted here because my focus is on the stolen weapons. Yet we must try worry about the song of the year with the same intensity that we worry about the stolen arms. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization. No related posts.
