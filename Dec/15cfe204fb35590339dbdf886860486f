The official website of Black First Land First (BLF) as well as that of the Black Consciousness online publisher, Black Opinion, came under cyber terrorist attacks yesterday. Both websites have been shut down since monday morning. We know that white monopoly capital (WMC) and its global anti black networks are terrified of the message and potential growth of BLF and the radical message of Black Consciousness carried by Black Opinion. BLF itself has been banned as a political party. The cyber terrorist attacks come at a time that BLF is gaining momentum with its announcement of an online membership process. Hundreds of people have joined BLF in the first few days. Furthermore, Black Opinion has become the most trusted source of analysis and news with over 200 000 viewings in the last three months. There is a constant drive by the enemies of black liberation to black out the message of BLF. Until our website is back online, we urge our people to access the online membership process directly via the link, https://blackfirstlandfirst.typeform.com/to/kpPazG Issued by Black First Land First, National Coordinating Committee of (BLF NCC) Contact Details Black First Land First Mail: blackfirstlandfirst@gmail.com Zanele Lwana
