Photo credit: iAfrica By Andile Mngxitama As we close 2019 I must admit that I was wrong to think Julius Malema would change. Malema‘s addiction to conspicuous consumption is too deep. I wrote a letter in 2011 in which I called Malema a ruthless politician. When Malema subsequently published the clarion call comprising of 7 cardinal pillars after losing everything, I thought that he was ready for the revolution. I then taught him the values of Thomas Sankara which he pretended to accept. Now I know that he never stopped being an addict of the Louis Vuitton lifestyle. Today I must admit that I was wrong to think that the chap could stop his addiction. He has now, through using Mandisa Makesini’s name, rejected Sankara openly. He is back to his 2011 ways – even using looted money to play Father Christmas with the poor. Vile! The full letter with the headnote “Comrade Malema, you are just another ruthless politician”, which was published by SowetanLive on 26 July 2011, may be accessed via the link: https://www.sowetanlive.co.za/opinion/columnists/2011-07-26-comrade-malema-you-are-just-another-ruthless-politician/?fbclid=IwAR2rRTtf-MkjT9sxKeh4BG8lJEGF-qIcgJuM-7BWstLcFS7tXwE8cPtvkCo Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
