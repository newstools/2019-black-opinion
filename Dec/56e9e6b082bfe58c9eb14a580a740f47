Photo credit: Anele.hoyana/Facebook Twenty five years after so called democracy, there is no evidence that white people in this country wish to end white domination. The continued murdering of black people by white racists is proof beyond reasonable doubt that 1994 changed nothing. The white farmer who murdered Anele Hoyana must have known that he is protected by the courts and Afriforum. We will do well to remember that the white men who murdered the young black man, Mahlomola Mosoeu, are out on bail through the assistance of Afriforum, pending the outcome of an appeal of their convictions and sentences. White people know that black lives don’t matter in South Africa. The South African law is against black people. Afriforum is allowed by our courts to deny that apartheid was a crime against humanity. They then use their money and the law to free those who murder black children. Black First Land First (BLF) has been saying that South Africa is anti black. For this truth BLF is banned from participating in the parliamentary elections process. Twenty five years after so called freedom we have seen not one gesture from white people to redress the oppression of colonialism and apartheid. That’s why BLF shall remain a blacks only organization fighting for black liberation!
