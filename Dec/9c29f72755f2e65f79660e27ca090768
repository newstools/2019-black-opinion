By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published on the Black First Land First website: Black First Land First (BLF) is not a friend of the white owned media. At the same time, BLF doesn’t believe that the looters of VBS Mutual Bank (VBS) and those involved in the corruption of tenders must be allowed to play apartheid censorship masters. The only reason that Julius Malema kicked out the Daily Maverick (DM) and
Amabhungane from its elective conference is because these publications have exposed the shocking theft of the money of the poor in VBS, amongst others. BLF holds that the media has created an intolerant mini dictator who has now come to bite it. It was all right for the media when Malema was encouraging the physical attack on ANN7 journalists. The mainstream media, because of its narrow interests, allowed Malema to determine what is acceptable media and what’s not. This was encouraged because at the relevant time Malema was the leading crusader against Jacob Zuma. The mainstream media and Malema were on the same side in the battle to remove Zuma. So Malema was given the license to undermine the fundamental rights of others, including media freedom. BLF calls on the media to reflect on how it has itself compromised media freedom when it so blatantly chose sides in the economic battles going on in the country. We condemn, in the strongest possible terms, the censorship of the media by the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) in its quest to hide its systemic looting of the money of the poor in VBS, in particular. The selective defence of rights promoted by our media is the shortest route to fascism.
