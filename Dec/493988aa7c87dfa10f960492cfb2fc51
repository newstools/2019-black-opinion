By Andile Mngxitama We were in Court today to note judgement in the Solidarity vs Black First Land First (BLF) case. No doubt this was going to be one of the worst judgements against us. Steve Biko stood with us and we made the enemy dizzy. I’m definitely going to write about Judge Mokgoatlheng’s conduct in relation to BLF soon. More specifically I will reveal how this hostile Judge was forced to be fair and follow judicial precedent. After we defeated Solidarity in court today in the hate speech complaint it laid against us, their Advocate one Groenewald turned to me and cried, “your bullying tactics worked”. I smiled and said, “ons kom vir die grond ook”. He turned the color of beetroot. Lol… BLF is closing 2019 on a lekker high!
