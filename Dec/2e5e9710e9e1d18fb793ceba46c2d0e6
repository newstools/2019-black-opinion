By Andile Mngxitama I’m fascinated by the revisionist interpretations of King Shaka (the nation builder) versus King Dingane (the anti colonial warrior). We must not be forced to choose between the two. They both played a very important role in our history. The intra royalty battles shouldn’t be elevated to a fundamental contradiction. On my part, I realize that for far too long Dingane has been denied his rightful place in history. I’m increasingly drawn to this great strategist. He treated the settlers with great suspicion and correctly regarded them as immoral criminals. Bulalani abathakathi!!!
