By Andile Mngxitama There are indeed compelling reasons to justify the conclusion that the load-shedding was a deliberate process of self sabotage to gauge how society would react. White monopoly capital (WMC) now has the data which it will analyze to measure how much support the idea of privatization of state owned enterprises (SOEs) has. Moreover it will use this data to determine if there would be any revolt against the system. Capital is evil! Itâ€™s always plotting. Remain vigilant!
