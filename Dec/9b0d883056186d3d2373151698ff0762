I hereby wish to apologize on behalf of Black First Land First (BLF) for the delay in responding to all those who have asked to join our movement, and to those who have expressed their commitment to lead in organizing in their areas. Kindly give us until monday. We are setting up an efficient online system for that purpose. We have had very bad experiences with membership databases. Please be patient with us. We shall revert with clear directives. 2020 is the year of AWAKENING & ORGANIZING! Issued by:
