He further made the execution of this mandate by the new executive committee a prerequisite for re-election at the next elective conference to be convened after five years. Black First Land First (BLF) President, Andile Mngxitama, strongly condemned Malema’s decision. “It’s so easy to impress blacks. Malema says he’s going to build one private school from money stolen from VBS instead of forcing government to fix public schools – and they all celebrate like headless chickens in the EFF. Do you know every year, 1 million children start school? Fuck off with your charity! We want good schools for all”, he said.
