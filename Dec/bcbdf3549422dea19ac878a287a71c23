By Andile Mngxitama By now many of us would have heard about how the African National Congress (ANC) and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) have betrayed blacks with the “Draft Constitution Eighteenth Amendment Bill, 2019”. Black First Land First (BLF) did caution that there shall be no land expropriation without compensation amendments. And this Bill shows exactly that. My heart tells me that proper land occupation will have to be launched on New Year’s Day! We are NOT talking about unused land. We are NOT talking about unproductive land. We ARE talking about proper land of white monopoly capital(WMC). What do revolutionaries do on the 31st at 24:00? Umoyawam awuvumi… land my people, land… These betrayals are too much!!! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization. No related posts.
