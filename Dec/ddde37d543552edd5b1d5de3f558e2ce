Photo credit: Al Jazeera By BO Staff Writer According to a recent survey released on Wednesday by the Invamer group, 70 percent of Colombians disapprove of President Ivan Duque leading the country. The national strike, which has greatly influenced the survey, was initiated by workers’ centrals and numerous civil society entities in Columbia on November 21, is continuing.. 79 % of citizens believe that the situation in Columbia is worsening. 49 percent believe that Colombia’s international relations outlook is very negative. 88 % of Colombians are most concerned about their insecurity; 84 % are concerned about government corruption; and 78% are concerned about the economy. The killing of Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia—People’s Army (FARC-EP) members by those close to President Duque is another matter of huge concern. The FARC-EP entered a peace accord in November 2016 with the Colombian Government of the former President Juan Manuel Santos. They were apparently deceived into abandoning their half a century arm struggle via the peace accord that the Colombian Government reneged on. Since signing the deal over 150 guerrillas and 500 other leaders in Columbia supportive of the cause were assassinated. FARC-EP’s plans include establishing a transitional government, coordinating a program with the National Liberation Army (ELN), as well as with those guerrillas who have not given up the fight for liberation. Duque and his administration lack the capacity to respond to the popular demands of the people. No related posts.
