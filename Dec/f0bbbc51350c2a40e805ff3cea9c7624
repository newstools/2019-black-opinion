This move was meant to officially mark “Reconciliation Day”. Among those pardoned are Fees Must Fall leader Khanya Cekesha, and the AbaThembu King, Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo. Excluded from the categories of offenders for pardons are those sentenced for sexual offences, armed robbery, mentally-ill persons, murder and attempted murder, sabotage, sedition, high treason, and terrorism. Black First Land First President, Andile Mngxitama, viewed the pardons as being made in bad faith by Ramaphosa in that it harbors a very sinister motive. “Cyril pardoned over 14 000 offenders to justify releasing the murderer of Chris Hani. No folks, it’s not about Khanya or King Dalindyebo. it’s about Janusz Walus, Hani’s killer…”, Mngxitama said. According to the Minister of Justice, Ronald Lamola, the implementation process would commence immediately and is likely to be finalized in about nine months.
