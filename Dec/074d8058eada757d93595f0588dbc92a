The investigation into 62 projects, relating to the state land lease and disposal policy (SLLDP), found that the wealthy were beneficiaries of 44% of these farms. It further indicates that farmworkers benefitted from just 18% of these farms The SLLDP is cast as government’s intention of improving access to land. It is ostensibly a process entailing the purchasing farms, appointing lessees or beneficiaries to them, and making them self-sustainable and productive. A previous investigation by Special Assignment (an SABC current affairs programme) into “corruption“ in the land reform process found that land reform by the elite entailed a process of ‘farm flipping’ in which farms in distress were bought by the elite from government at very low prices; the farms were then resold to government at excessively high prices; and thereafter the same elite returned as strategic partners to the farms for further their interests. Andile Mngxitama, the President of the black consciousness organization Black First Land First (BLF), responded yesterday to the Plaas report on social media. “The idea that some blacks don’t deserve to own land stems from the usual anti black liberal bullshit. Their own report says 44% of the farmland is “elite” owned. Also you will be shocked by their definition of elite. White Marxists are strange. They have title deeds and inheritances from the colonial loot but castigate any black who has anything more than the poorest of the poor. They love the poor so that they can give them charity. And all blacks who aren’t dead poor are corrupt according to them”, Mngxitama said. No related posts.
