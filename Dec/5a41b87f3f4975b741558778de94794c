The former PT’s treasurer Joao Vaccari and former Finance Ministers Antonio Palocci and Guido Mantega were also acquitted in the same case known as the “PT’s quadrillion”. More specifically they were all accused of setting up a criminal entity to channel money from state-owned companies (SOCs) like Petrobras (an oil company) to finance the electoral campaigns of PT. Cristiano Zanin, the lawyer of Lula tweeted: “Before an impartial judge, we have obtained Lula’s summary acquittal. The Brazilian magistrate highlighted an ‘attempt to criminalize political activity’ by the misplaced charge known as the ‘quadrillion,’ which is part of lawfare against Lula”. The extraction of money for the benefit of PT was alleged to have occurred during the tenures of Lula from 2003 to 2010, and Rousseff from 2011 to 2016. The presiding Federal judge found that the accusations “do not even allow the conclusion of a structurally organized association of four or more people, with a division of tasks, or some form of hierarchy and stability.” The judge further found that there was an attempt to “criminalize political activity” because the accusation “assumed that there was a criminal organization, which lasted until the presidency of Dilma Rousseff, without even pointing out essential elements to characterize such criminal activity.” No related posts.
