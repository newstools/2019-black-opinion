BY BO Staff writer A picture of a group of white men at the conference of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has been making its rounds on social media. Many have been asking, who are these white men, and what are they doing at a conference of a party that claims to be Marxist-Leninist and wanting to expropriate white capital? Many theories in relation to these questions have also been circulating. One such theory which has gained traction is that these white men are the true owners of the EFF. They had attended the conference to make sure that their investments are secured. The EFF, according to this theory, is guided and sponsored by both London, via Lord Robin Renwick, and Stellenbosch, through mainly Johann Rupert. Then there is the ever present Adriano Mazzotti, who is the main direct benefactor of Julius Malema. Rumour has it that the different handlers have consolidated their management process so as to avoid the confusion that often happens where conflicting instructions are given to the Reds of London. The EFF has kept mum about the identities of these white men and what they want. This is not the first time that the party has concealed from its members dealings with imperialists forces. The minutes and footage of the meeting held in London in 2015 by the representatives of British imperialism with the leaders of the EFF, were promised to the public but never released. The EFF keeps talking black, but acting white. Has the identity of the white hand been unwittingly revealed? No related posts.
