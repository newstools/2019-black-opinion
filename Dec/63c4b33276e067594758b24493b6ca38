Picture: The South African The deepening energy crisis in the country is a self made crisis to speed up the process of privatizing Eskom. This is the firm belief of Black First Land First (BLF. The move by the power utility to stage 6 loadshedding from 6pm today, is a ploy to punish our people into submission to justify the selling off of Eskom to the funders of Cyril Ramaphosa. Eskom, like the South African Airways (SAA), will be given to those who bought the Presidency of the African National Congress (ANC), via the Nasrec conference, with R1 billion. The answer to loadshedding is known by all. The combined leadership of Eskomâ€™s former chairman Dr Ben Ngubane, former acting CEO Matshela Koko and former CEO Brian Molefe had not only stopped loadshedding, it had also ensured that Eskom realized a profit. BLF says, stop playing evil games! End loadshedding! Bring back the super team of Dr Ngubane, Koko and Molefe!
