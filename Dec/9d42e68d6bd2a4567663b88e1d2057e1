Photo credit: africanexponent.com By BO Staff Writer Forty seven men, who were charged with publicly displaying affection with other men, stood trial on Wednesday in a Nigerian court. Upon conviction each of the accused persons face a term of imprisonment of up to 10 years. The offence is said to be based on violations of the Same Sex Marriage Prohibition Act, which was promulgated into law by President Goodluck Jonathan in 2014 to prohibit homosexual and queer marriages in Nigeria. The legislation accordingly criminalizes marriages as well as displays of love and affection between persons of the same sex. Andile Mngxitama, the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a black consciousness organization called for the scrapping of the anti gay and queer legislation. “Nigeria is one of the top ten oil producers in the world. It is supposed to be rich and responding to its people’s total needs. But it is poverty stricken due to looting by imperialism in cahoots with settler white monopoly capital via politicians corrupted for a lifestyle of gluttonous consumption. This same anti people government of Nigeria is busy putting people in jail for being gay and queer? Can they get out of the consenting adult’s bedrooms, please. Who anyone chooses to love is not a matter of the state. Our governments are jokes”, Mngxitama said in strong condemnation of the actions of the Nigerian government and others like it. To those sympathetic to patriarchy, sexism, and homophobia and supportive of the Nigerian government, Mngxitama said: “This is nonsense. If you are “straight” why are you bothered about gay people? You aren’t involved akere?” No related posts.
