Think about what 19 well trained persons can do with the 19 R4 assault rifles that was stolen from the SA Army base, and yet Ramaphosa is keeping it cool. We also can’t forget Johann Rupert’s admission of having a private army. An obvious question is, are those weapons in the hands of the CR17 campaign sponsors? Also, what mayhem will be unleashed with these weapons in the black communities? Ramaphosa’s silence is shocking, actually. The whole thing looks suspicious… Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization. No related posts.
