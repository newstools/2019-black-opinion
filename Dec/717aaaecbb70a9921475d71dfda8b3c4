By BO Staff Writer On Monday the rapper Sho Madjozi was trending on Twitter for her comments on her eight hours delay at the OR Tambo international in taking a flight to Port Elizabeth. “Business rescue on SAA, my friend. But if you wanna go deeper; it’s because of mass looting of state funds under (former president Jacob Zuma)”, she tweeted.  Many denounced her unjustified accusations against President Zuma including Black First Land First President, Andile Mngxitama. “Sho Madjozi must learn from the likes of AKA…”, Mngxitama remarked alluding to AKA’s response on Twitter on the Eskom energy crisis.  Mngxitama also called Madjozi out for being a stooge of white monopoly capital: “The problem with celebrities is shallowness. I thought Sho was smarter than this level of Sunday Times induced stupidity. But actually she is much smarter than that. She is singing for Johann Rupert to ensure her supper. I’m inclined to think that she knows what she is doing. She has chosen the side of white monopoly capital, the side of money”, he said. No related posts.
