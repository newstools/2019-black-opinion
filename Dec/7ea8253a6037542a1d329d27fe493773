By Andile Mngxitama The EFF was together with eNCA in the same crooked place when they helped kill ANN7. Now with the VBS looting and tender fraud revelations, there’s a fallout amongst friends and we must boycott their friends? When Johann Rupert calls tomorrow and they all make peace again, where shall we be? No, let them tell us, what has changed about the eNCA? Take this open letter (see link below) by the former eNCA news journalist Phakamile Hlubi, which was published in the City Press on 9 July 2016, for instance. Everybody knew then that Johann Rupert’s eNCA was racist but because the agenda was ‘Zuma and the Guptas must go’, these hypocrites were happy to serve Rupert. Please if you share this letter which correctly describes eNCA as racist, do alert the readers that it’s from 2016 when Malema and them didn’t give a damn about racism because at that time they were allowed to loot. Now that they are no longer needed by Stellenbosch and London, they want us to forget? Nee fok andizi! I will watch eNCA when I want to. I hate it anyways. l don’t watch it generally but I won’t be told by flip floppers to boycott their friends because they are now having a family feud. See Hlubi’s full letter, published in the article “Open letter paints eNCA as ‘haven of racism”, can be accessed via the link, https://city-press.news24.com/News/enca-staffer-resigns-urges-management-to-do-better-20160709?fbclid=IwAR3RwkGMnppIq77d0Lt3bYyx_RpARC8zkKeLfOLmBEe8XVV_RX7kgi7UFsk Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
