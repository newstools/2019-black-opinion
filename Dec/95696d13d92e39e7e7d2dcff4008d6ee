By BO Staff Writer The following message posted on Facebook by Andile Mngxitama shortly after midnight was, as promised, taken down. Luckily BO had saved it before Mngxitama deleted it from his page. Here-below we publish it for your reading pleasure: I will delete this post before the sleepists wake up. Life is indifferent to your personal struggles. Time is no marker of good or bad fortunes. It will always be on the march to nowhere in particular. The bad things happening to you has got nothing to do with God or ancestors. It’s a mere convergence of your own bad choices or choices of forces you can’t control, or both at the same time. You aren’t being punished for anything by some bigger force out there. There will be no rewards as compensation for your misfortunes. The good times that come are also based on the same principles. You can make yourself lucky sometimes. We need to make better choices at many different levels, including on how to mitigate the impact of forces that we can’t control. Changing the current anti black socio economic political structure is part of such a struggle. The temptation is to think that you are experiencing bad luck because of some evil forces working 24/7 against you. No, it’s the structure that you are born into that determines your choices by and large. Let’s make better choices for ourselves. Let’s make a revolution! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization. No related posts.
