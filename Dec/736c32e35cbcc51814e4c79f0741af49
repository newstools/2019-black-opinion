Photo credit: Free State Health Department / Twitter By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published on the Black First Land First website: Black First Land First (BLF) maintains that the irregular weather patterns that cause floods are a direct consequence of the global white power structure. These disasters are not natural. They are created by the white man. There is little doubt that these extreme weather patterns are a direct consequence of global warming, which is a creation of the gluttony of the white system of accumulation and consumption. The current floods are obviously impacting severely on black people because of landlessness. Black people are forced to build houses in the flood lines, dried rivers and other precarious pieces of land. The good land is in white hands and occupied. Unfortunately some organizations, like the Reds of Mazzotti, have been encouraging the landless to occupy reject land. This reject, unoccupied land is not fit for human settlement and hence we see the devastating impact of the floods on blacks. Addressing both rural and urban land hunger, is the only long term solution to some of the adverse effects of these white man made disasters. These floods make us to ask yet again, “where are the promised land expropriation without compensation amendments to the constitution?” BLF is of the firm belief that there shall be no such amendments because those who were supposed to push the land agenda are addicted to Louis Vuitton, Range Rovers and houses in Sandton.
