By Andile Mngxitama On Wednesday I shall publish a short evaluation of the Marxist Leninists of the Party of the Red Berets. My research to date shows that their achievements as tools of white monopoly capital (WMC) are staggering. If you were to look closely, you will see that the distance between self validating rhetoric and essence is too wide. Itâ€™s the duty of all revolutionaries to subject all movements and individuals, who proclaim their adherence to revolutionary creed, to critical analysis. V.I. Lenin made the Mensheviks his project. In South Africa (SA), Steve Biko made the liberals the focus of his critique. It is for good reasons therefore that I go into an evaluation of our WMC sponsored Marxist Leninists. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization. No related posts.
