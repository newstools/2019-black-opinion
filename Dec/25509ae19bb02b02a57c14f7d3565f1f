Photo credit: sundominica.com Black First Land First (BLF) congratulates Dominica’s ruling Labor Party (DLP) led by Roosevelt Skerrit on winning the country’s general elections and securing 18 of the 21 constituencies, against the Lennox Linton led United Workers’ Party (UWP) that obtained only 3 constituencies. It is instructive that the electoral campaign of the opposition UWP was sponsored by the U.S. and the Organization of American States (OAS). BLF denounces claims by the pro right wing UWP and its sponsors of electoral fraud. We salute Skerrit for leading the DLP to an outright victory in the elections yesterday so as to enable it to lead the country for the next five years., BLF wishes the Dominican people success in strengthening the stability that has been developed under the Presidency of Skerrit over his past three terms in power, especially in housing, transportation, education and health. Long live President Skerrit! Victory to the Dominica Issued by the National Coordinating Committee of Black First Land First (BLF NCC) 7 December 2019 Contact details Black First Land First Email:blackfirstlandfirst@gmail.com Technical Advisor, International Relations: Shantha Balakrishna
