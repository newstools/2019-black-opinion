By Andile Mngxitama Yay! I was listening to Kamvelihle Goba and Sergio Malatji Tsietsi via a social media live broadcast yesterday. These are solid young cadres who believe in the revolution. I was indeed shocked to learn that: 1. Julius Malema was given blue-light protection by Cyril Ramaphosa.
2. Floyd Shivambu was given a tender by the University of Johannesburg (UJ), apparently for helping the university to suspend Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) student leaders.
3. The EFF Limpopo secretary was also using the Student Representative Council (SRC) for tenders. We must pray for these young revolutionaries. There is a Gestapo like thing in the EFF, the so called “Defenders of the Revolution (DOR)”, which is used to brutalize any voices of revolutionary vision and critique. Goba also raised broader issues of ideological degeneration. By this afternoon I will produce the piece I promised on how the Marxist Leninists of the Reds of Mazzotti have strayed from the revolution to serve capital. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization. No related posts.
