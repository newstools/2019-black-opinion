By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published on the Black First Land First website and is now reissued by Black Opinion: It is beyond reasonable doubt that there will be no amendment to the constitution to effect land expropriation without compensation (LEWC). Parliament is scheduled to be dissolved by the end of March this year for the general elections. As Black First Land First (BLF) has consistently said, there will be no amendment to the constitution. Yesterday during the joint sitting of parliament when Ramaphosa’s state of the nation address (SONA) was being debated the the Chief Whip of the African National Congress (ANC), Jackson Mthembu, misled to the nation yet again. He claim that the constitution will be amended. This is a blatant lie. Procedurally, there is no possibility of an amendment going through before parliament is dissolved for the forthcoming elections. That Mthembu is lying is known to both the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and the ANC, but both organizations are sworn to an oath of deception. The landless deserve to know the truth about what is going on about land expropriation. The ANC and EFF lied about land expropriation in February 2018. They never intended to do it. BLF will be writing to the speaker of parliament to ask her to take action against the lying Mthembu. It is clear that right now there is no organization in parliament that represents the interests of the landless. BLF will never betray the landless majority. That’s why it will be in parliament!
