By BO Staff Writer Last night, the State of the Nation Address (SONA) was a boring peaceful event, thanks to Lord Robin Renwick. Sources close to Julius Malema say Renwick called the leader of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) around 5pm, just before the SONA, and instructed him to sit like a good High School boy during the event. That’s exactly what happened. Lord Robin Renwick is the powerful representative of the Queen of England who is credited for persuading Nelson Mandela to abandon the policy of nationalization of the “commanding heights of the economy”. In 2015, the leadership of the EFF asked to meet Renwick in London, that’s where they were instructed to stop the campaign to occupy ABSA. The party was also instructed to give political power to the racist Democratic Alliance (DA) in the metros. Renwick is a man of means and dispenses alms to his underlings. The EFF is flush with British pounds according to sources. Big daddy Renwick is providing for his children. The downside of the capture of the EFF by London is that there is no opposition to Cyril Ramaphosa in the parliament. The EFF has been tamed by pounds. The EFF had threatened to disrupt the SONA for the BOSASA scandal. Ramaphosa has just paid back the loot he used to buy the ANC Nasrec conference. This is tantamount to admission of guilt. It was left to Black First Land First (BLF) to fight the corruption of Ramaphosa. The movement opened criminal cases against Ramaphosa to hold him accountable. No related posts.
