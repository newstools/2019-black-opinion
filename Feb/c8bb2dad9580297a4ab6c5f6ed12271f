By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published on the Black First Land First website and is now reissued by Black Opinion: Black First Land First (BLF) condemns the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) for promoting the racist Johann Rupert’s wine at its Gala Dinner. First our people were sold for tea in London over #OccupyABSA, now our people are sold for expensive wine over the land question. The EFF cannot claim to be a revolutionary political party that is fighting White Monopoly Capital (WMC) and then promote the businesses and products of the Stellenbosch cabal, led by Rupert. This proves that the EFF is unprincipled and subservient to whites. The same EFF that claims to be revolutionary and wears overalls in Parliament, dines in Gucci and drinks Rupert’s wine at night. There are many black-owned wine brands that need exposure and support which the EFF could have promoted, but just like the African National Congress (ANC), they put white people first and support white businesses for their own personal gain. In promoting the Stellenbosch mafia’s wine at the Gala Dinner last night, Malema clearly appealed to Rupert for more funding for himself and the EFF. Both will be duly rewarded. BLF reminds the black majority that this is the same EFF that took people’s votes and gave power to the racist Democratic Alliance (DA) in key metros. BLF reitarates that the EFF are house negroes that use the plight of the landless to serve the interest of WMC and laugh all the way to the bank. There is only one revolutionary movement in this country and that is Black First Land First! Issued by Black First Land First, National Coordinating Committee (BLF NCC)
