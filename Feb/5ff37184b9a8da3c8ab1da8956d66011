By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published on the Black First Land First website and is now reissued by Black Opinion: Black First Land First (BLF) has received a response from President Ramaphosa saying that there will be no further action taken regarding our request to set up a Judicial Commission of Inquiry (JCOI) into both the allegations of him being an apartheid spy and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) being linked to the MI6 and the British throne via Lord Robin Renwick. BLF had already cautioned the President that by virtue of the serious allegations against him, he is conflicted. Moreover, he will therefore not be in a position to act impartially in setting up the required JCOI. President Ramaphosaâ€™s denial of our request for JCOI proves his conflict of interest and lack of objectivity in this matter. Now the path open to us is to take the matter to the High Court for the necessary relief including that the Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng makes the relevant appointments for the institution of the JCOI. BLF has briefed lawyers with the necessary instructions and shall advise the public of further developments.
