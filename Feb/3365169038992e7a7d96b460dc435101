By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published on the Black First Land First website and is now reissued by Black Opinion: Black First Land First (BLF) will tomorrow open a case of crimen injuria against the former COO of Bosasa, Angelo Agrizzi, in that he had impaired the dignity of blacks including the directors of Bosasa, namely Papa Leshabane and Joe Gumede by repeatedly referring to them as kaffirs. This evidence emerged during Agrizzi’s testimony before the Judicial Commission of Inquiry into State Capture (Zondo Commission) this past Monday when an audio recording of him making the racist remarks was presented and put to him. Quite clearly Agrizzi’s racist remarks has implications amongst other things for the nature and intention of the entire body of evidence he has presented to the Zondo Commission. This evidence suggests certain allegedly corrupt relationships forged by Bosasa with people of influence including politicians and journalists. BLF’s position is that Agrizzi was entirely motivated by racism. BLF will ensure that Agrizzi is charged, prosecuted and be made to pay fully for his crimes that amount to racism. Agrizzi will be criminally charged under the following details: Date: 2 February 2019
Time: 13:00
Venue: Hilbrow Police Station, 1 Clarendon Place, Hillbrow, Johannesburg A media briefing will subsequently be held outside the Hillbrow Police Station at 13h00.
