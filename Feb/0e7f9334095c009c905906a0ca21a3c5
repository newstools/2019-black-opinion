By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published on the Black First Land First website and is now reissued by Black Opinion: Deputy Minister of Finance Mondli Gungubele is implicated in serious criminal activities involving corruption at the Public Investment Corporation (PIC). Black First Land First (BLF) says it is not enough to resign from the board of the PIC. He must also resign as Deputy Finance Minister. BLF calls on Gungubele to resign immediately. Furthermore, BLF demands that Cyril Ramaphosa accepts the resignation of the PIC board. Should Gungubele not also resign as Deputy Finance Minister, then Ramaphosa must fire him. There can be no tolerance of corruption, more so by those who claim to be on a crusade against corruption. Issued by Black First Land First, National Coordinating Committee (BLF NCC)
