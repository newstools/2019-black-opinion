The NAM countries further emphasized the need to practice international cooperation, promote world peace and achieve sustainable development. Venezuela assumed presidency of NAM in 2016 which is expected to expire at the end of this year. Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza, who chaired the meeting, condemned US’s contravention of the United Nations Charter and other international law norms. He further denounced the US’s imposition of the blockade on Venezuela and the general imperialist attack on the nation. He also pointed out the intention of the US to tire the people into submission and to wear down their will in this respect. In the meanwhile the US and its regional allies are planning to revive the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance (TIAR) so as to unleash military aggression against Venezuela. Arreaza called on NAM members to continue the struggle towards attaining a new and just world system. No related posts.
