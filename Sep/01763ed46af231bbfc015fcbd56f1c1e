Credit: social media By Andile Mngxitama The populist says, “Africa is one, open the border!” For this he gets massive applause from Africans desperate to get into South Africa (SA). This is a good fundraising strategy. His political sidekick says, “[f]oreigners must go! The police must deal with them”. The desperate Africans are confused and hate the sidekick put in power by the populist who says he loves them. White monopoly capital (WMC) benefits from the open border call because it uses it to repress the National Minimum Wage Bill and to fire South African workers. This is the Pan Afrikanism of Cecil John Rhodes. The truck drivers on both sides of the border are left to fend for themselves as they continue to be put at war with each other by transborder capitalist exploitation.
Beware of populists. They serve the status quo! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First, a revolutionary black consciousness movement. No related posts.
