By Andile Mngxitama Today is Heritage Day in South Africa (SA). Before you start the braai please do a quick “who owns what” audit with the kids. Get the children to participate in the audit by going through each item in the following list, which is going to be used for the braai, to check who owns it: 1. Braai stand
2. All the meat (check each package of meat)
3. Camp chairs
4. Beverages (both soft and alcoholic)
5. Snacks
6. Clothes Look at the list. Tell them to enjoy the braai but to never stop asking questions. Education is painful. Lets build a heritage we can be proud of… Andile Mngxitama, is the President of Black First Land First (BLF) which is a revolutionary black consciousness movement. No related posts.
