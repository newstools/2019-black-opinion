By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published on the Black First Land First website: The 24th of September is the date that the great African moderniser, military genius and nation builder King Shaka was assassinated. This is Shaka Day! The African National Congress (ANC), driven by love for the coloniser and tribalism, has erased instead of elevating King Shaka. Today instead of reflecting on this African giant and what his genius means for us, we have a braai day of no substance at all. We remain oppressed by the enemy that King Shaka warned us about. We remain divided as a show of the unfinished business of nation building started by King Shaka. Instead of taking off where the great King had left off and using his unsurpassed legacy, the ANC chooses to celebrate an undefined “heritage” in bondage. What “heritage” do landless people have? Black First Land First (BLF) will campaign for this day to be called its rightful name, KING SHAKA DAY! Bayede!!! The best tribute that we can pay to the great warrior King, is to defend the Ingonyama Trust and to demand land expropriation without compensation now! We bow before the great King. Long live the spirit of King Shaka, long live!
