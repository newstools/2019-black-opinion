By Andile Mngxitama Now that you are gone, your tormentors will hijack your legacy and try to legitimate themselves. Emmerson Mnagagwa sold you out. Robin Renwick unleashed his South African agents on you. They called you a dictator who must step down. We draw inspiration from your clarity of purpose; and your bravery and commitment to the liberation of black people. You did more than all of the sellout weak SADC leaders ever did. For this, the white world has tried to condemn you. But the people know who its leaders are. Long live the spirit of Comrade Robert Gabriel Mugabe! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First, a revolutionary black consciousness movement. No related posts.
