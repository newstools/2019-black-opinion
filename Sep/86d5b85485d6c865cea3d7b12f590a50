By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published on the Black First Land First website: The untransformed South African Rugby national team is at the world cup playing for white supremacy. This is borne out by the callous arrogant manner in which the South African Rugby Union (SARU) has treated the serious allegations of racism against the Springbok lock Eben Etzebeth. To this end Etzebeth has been accused of criminal acts of racism emanating from his involvement in a bar fight in Langebaan in the Western Cape on 25 August this year. Despite the victims of the racist attack having constantly raised the matter, the management of SARU didn’t think that the complaint warranted action. On the contrary the alleged acts of racism have been rewarded. Etzebeth, is part of the National team and as such purports to represent South Africa (SA). Black First Land First (BLF) has never recognized the Bokke as a South African team. It’s a team that represents white supremacy that has kept blacks in bondage. BLF does however recognize the presence in the Springboks of the individual brilliant black players who are the true representatives of the black majority. However the team itself represents colonialism and apartheid. We call on SARU to send Etzebeth back to SA, forthwith. We also call for a Springbok team that represents the demographics of SA. BLF further calls on the black Bokke to object to being fielded alongside the white racist Etzebeth who must be made to account for his serious crimes driven by racism.
