By Andile Mngxitama Contrary to what the white thinking Marxists and economic reductionists believe, our extermination as black people was not for economic reasons. Our extermination was a symbolic act to stop black liberation and assert white supremacy. It was certainly not just for economic reasons. Why do you think Black First Land First (BLF) is banned in South Africa (SA)? It’s for the same reason Napoleon Bonaparte attacked Haiti – to stop the march of blacks in the world. Nothing terrified whites and colonised blacks like the possibility of BLF in parliament where it would disrupt the lie of democracy and freedom. If you are black and uncomfortable with being black first, it’s because of what the legacy of being oppressed has done to you. Anti blackness is etched into your soul. Today is ‘Heritage Day” in SA. We blacks celebrate white heritage because a landless people have no heritage. We must make a heritage we can be proud of, a heritage of victory over the colonizer!
