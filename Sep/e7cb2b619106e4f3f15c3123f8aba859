By Andile Mngxitama I just saw an advertisement by a white monopoly capital (WMC) business advertising how to cook chicken feet. Basically, they are coming for everything! This is a heritage of dispossession. They first ate the best parts of the chicken, including the drumsticks. They then threw the chicken heads and feet at us. We off course then turned lemon into lemonade. We prepared the chicken feet and all the other left overs from the chicken, and ate it for survival. We prepared those parts of the chicken that WMC considered as not being fit for human consumption, and threw away. When they saw us eating the chicken feet, they began preparing, packaging and selling it to us at a profit. They are making money from that which they never wanted. They now own the recipe too. The took the land. They took the cows. They took the chicken. And now they are back to even take the chicken feet. We have no heritage. We are dispossessed!
