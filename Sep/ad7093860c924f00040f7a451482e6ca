By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published on the Black First Land First website: Media reports show that a preliminary pathology report rules out suicide in the death of Gavin Watson. Black First Land First (BLF) is not surprised. In fact we feel vindicated. We never believed that Gavin Watson was involved in an accident. For us, it looked and smelled like a hit. All indications shows that it was a hit. If you want to know who is behind the hit, just answer this question: who is the biggest beneficiary of this murder? In our August 26 statement, we said: “BLF doesn’t believe that Watson died from an accident in the same way we don’t believe that Faber died from natural causes. There is a need for an independent investigation into these sudden deaths of people close to the uncovered corruption around the CR17 campaign.” BLF is indeed vindicated.
