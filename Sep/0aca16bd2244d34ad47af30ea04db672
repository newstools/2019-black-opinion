Photo credit: SABC Digital News By BO Staff Writer Comrade Robert Mugabe, the former President of Zimbabwe, has been buried today in his native village Kutama, Zvimba district. The burial took place weeks after Mugabe’s death on September 6th in Singapore, and two years after a US sponsored coup replaced him with the current President Emmerson Mnangagwa thereby ending his revolutionary 37-year rule. Mnangagwa was a once-trusted deputy of Mugabe, who went rogue. Initially intended to be a private family ceremony, the burial was attended by hundreds of mourners  including Mugabe’s widow Grace and his children. Notably no senior government officials were in attendance including President Mnangagwa. Following the coup in 2017, Mugabe’s wish was that he should not be buried at the shrine in Harare. He was apparently livid about the manner in which he was removed from power. He did not want to be buried in the same place with those who betrayed him and the revolution. The family of Mugabe were previously amenable to the government’s request to bury him at the Heroes Acre in Harare. They had one condition – that a mausoleum be built at the hilltop to separate Mugabe from his betrayers. On Thursday the Zimbabwean government announced that the family had changed its mind. “ZANU-PF betrayed Comrade Mugabe. He decided to free himself from his tormentors. He was burried away from the coupists. This great warrior will in good time be burried at the Heroes Acre where he rightfully belongs – under a new revolutionary goverment of the people of Zimbabwe. #MugabeismLives!” said Andile Mngxitama, the President of the radical black consciousness organization, Black First Land First (BLF).
