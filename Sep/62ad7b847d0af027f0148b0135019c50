By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published on the Black First Land First website: The war against Black women continues unabated despite government dedicating one month every year to women. The murder of Uyinene Mrwetyana is symptomatic of this ongoing war. Black First Land First (BLF) calls on black men in particular to stop the war on black women and on themselves. As the nation was mourning yet another senseless murder of the women boxing champion, Leighandre “Baby Lee” Jegels, we were faced with news that Uyinene was also murdered. These are two high profile cases which only reflect symptoms that indicate the tip of the iceberg. There is war in the black community. The black man has become a violent subhuman who doesn’t hesitate to violate and take lives. The nation and families must increase awareness and education on violence in the black communities, especially gender based violence. We must refuse to lose the war against women oppression. May this tragic murder of a young black woman galvanise society to say, “enough is enough”. May the death of Uyinene not be in vain. BLF calls on all black men to enter into dialogue amongst themselves and work out a covenant with the black community where they commit to stop the war.
