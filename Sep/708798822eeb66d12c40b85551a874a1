By Andile Mngxitama Ranjeni Munusamy, Karima Brown and Julius Malema were lepers in the eyes of white monopoly capital (WMC) media towards the 52nd African National Congress (ANC), Polokwane Conference held in December 2007, because they were in team Jacob Zuma. They won when Zuma was elected as the President of the ANC and subsequently became the President of the country in 2009. After this, the trio defected to the enemy. They were sanitized and forgiven. They became the front attack dogs against Zuma. WMC took care of them. It employed and promoted them. When Zuma established ANN7 to counter the WMC propaganda, the trio went on an overdrive. They destroyed ANN7. Today we have heard allegations which link Julius and his party to tender corruption in Joberg and Tshwane. Moreover the Zondo Commission of Inquiry has just heard allegations that Ranjeni Munusamy, the Tiso Blackstar group associate editor, abused the Police Criminal Intelligence Unit “slush fund”. To this end she had benefited when an amount of R143 621.78 was used from the said “slush fund” to pay off her motor vehicle debt with Wesbank Vehicle Finance, in 2008. The other big story is that an independent probe into allegations of editorial interference and censorship has found that the journalist Karima Brown had contravened the provisions of the Broadcasting Complaints Commission code of South Africa in that her allegations of a patronage network was not balanced. Well now that Ranjeni, Karima, and Julius are no longer needed by WMC, they are being thrown under the bus. There is no honor amongst thieves! WMC doesn’t forget… Andile Mngxitama, is the President of Black First Land First (BLF) which is a revolutionary black consciousness movement. No related posts.
