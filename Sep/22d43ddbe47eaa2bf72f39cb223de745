By BO Staff Writer The matter of Black First Land First v AfriForum & Kallie Kriel was heard in the Equality Court sitting in the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court under Case No EQ 05/2019, on Thursday 26 September 2019. The case before the Court was that Kallie Kriel’s utterances that “apartheid was not a crime against humanity” amounts to hate speech in that it contravenes section 10 of the Equality Act. Black First Land First (BLF) did not have legal representation in the matter. Andile Mngxitama accordingly represented BLF as its President. Here’s Mngxitama delivering argument in court on behalf of BLF after the close of pleadings: https://youtu.be/lLPyJqf0tcY No related posts.
