By Andile Mngxitama South African politics have been normalised as politics. Basically, the game of how the powerful maintains their power and the status qou is protected. For a little while around 2014, there was a glimmer of hope that mainstream politics would be disrupted from within the arena of bourgeois politics. This has come to pass as the expected disruptors settled for tenders and a life of Louis Vuitton, while only simulating disruption. The DNA of South African politics is corruption, accumulation and deception. The ideological glue that keeps it all together is money. Stellenbosch still stands and London celebrates. The aspirations of the children of Brett Kebble have been acknowledged as a South African version of the aspirations of the United States sponsored Fulgencio Batista regime which came to power in Cuba in 1952 via a coup; reversed the gains of the revolution since the country’s independence in 1940; and filled the Cuban people with deep indignation. Che Guevara and Fidel Castro, via the July 26th Movement, seized the time and laid siege to the Batista regime. The bearded mountain rebels are yet to make their presence felt in this country. We have to start all over again for Stellenbosch and its trinkets to fall… Andile Mngxitama, is the President of Black First Land First (BLF) which is a revolutionary black consciousness movement.
