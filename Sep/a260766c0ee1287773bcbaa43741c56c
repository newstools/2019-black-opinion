To All Media Houses: On Fri, 18th September 2019, I received some questions from a journalist unknown to me, Aubrey of the Sunday World regarding allegations that I may be involved in the murder of the late Mr Bozwana according what he claimed was information at his disposal In brief, I told the journalist that I will not respond to these allegations for three reasons: 1. Itâ€™s a complete fabricated lies made against me by some leaders of the ANC since my deployment as NW Premier in 2014/15 2. The allegations are part of a plan to destroy me in all forms of my existence by some ANC members and that this I will speak about in detail sometimes in the future 3. These are attempts to silence me from my vocal activism in ANC politics and such attempts will never succeed because I will never keep quite on things done wrongly in the ANC I just hope that the resuscitation of these lies, is not part of what some of the ANC people have been saying that I must either be arrested or be killed and therefore preparing society for such an eventuality On the approach adopted by this journalist and the Sunday World on this matter , I will exercise my rights on how to deal with such going forward Supra Mahumapelo No related posts.
