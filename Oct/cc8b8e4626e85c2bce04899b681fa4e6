By Andile Mngxitama Today Cyril Ramaphosa’s government of Stellenbosch and London starts the process of convicting President Zuma. Those who voted for Ramaphosa, knew that they were empowering him to lock Zuma up. There you have your wish ladies and gentlemen. You don’t want change. You are happy for South Africa (SA) to be white ruled. Anyone who says that the court will be fair to Zuma, is a fool. This is class warfare through the courts. Who controls the courts? It’s not the poor or those who want change like Zuma. They are going to set an example with Zuma. Next in line are the VBS looters from Limpopo in Gucci suits, driving expensive cars like Range Rovers, and shouting Marxist Leninist empty slogans. We warned you not to vote for Ramaphosa. We warned you about the Mazzotti boys. You said you will solve the problem internally. Own up to your decisions. You helped put Zuma in jail! Good morning maSuffer Africa.
