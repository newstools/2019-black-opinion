By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published on the Black First Land First website: The Court will tomorrow deliver judgement on the complaint of Black First Land First (BLF) against the rightwing Kallie Kriel and Afriforum, under the following details: Date: 29 October 2019
Time: 8:30am
Venue: Court 25, Equality Court sitting at the Johannesburg Magistrate Court
Complaint: hate speech The matter was last in court on 26 September 2019 when arguments were heard from both sides. The case before the Court was that Kallie Kriel’s utterances that “apartheid was not a crime against humanity” amounts to hate speech in that it contravenes section 10 of the Equality Act. Black First Land First (BLF) pointed out that the said utterances are in contravention of international law which has been legislated upon and implemented in South Africa (SA), amongst other things. The racist Afriforum is known for inter alia defending the apartheid flag; opposing every measure intended to redress apartheid induced imbalances, and funding the legal representation to defend convicted Afrikaner criminals (Pieter Doorewaard and Phillip Schutte) who killed a black child, Matlhomola Mosweu in 2017. BLF did not have legal representation in the matter. Andile Mngxitama accordingly represented the organization as its President. We have asked the court to take the appropriate action against these racists.
