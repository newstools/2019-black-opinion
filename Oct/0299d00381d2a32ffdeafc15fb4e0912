By BO Staff Writer The recent report by the Daily Maverick (DM), which was published on Sunday, provides further proof of VBS looting which directly implicates EFF leaders Floyd Shivambu and Julius Malema. Andile Mngxitama, the President of Black First Land First (BLF), was not surprised.
“The comprador laughs at broke people while stealing from them to sponsor its lifestyle. The people who were the most indignant about President Zuma’s “corruption” are merciless. They don’t care at all”, Mngxitama said.
Evidence now reveals that Floyd used VBS over 500 million rand of the poor (mainly from Limpopo) to do his 2017 wedding. It is clear that payments for the wedding were made from the bank account of Grand Azania – a company owned by Floyd’s brother, Brian Shivambu. Floyd Shivambu in the meantime denies any links to Grand Azania. It is already a matter of public knowledge that Grand Azania got R6.16-million of the VBS loot and R8.74-million from about 15 other suspicious sources. In this regard Floyd has not made any declaration of payments in the registers of Parliament for 2017 and 2018. Indications are that Floyd will be hauled before Parliament’s ethics committee to answer for his conduct. “The evidence is overwhelming! These compromised characters will not ensure economic freedom for the people. Their former white friends who sponsored them have kept the receipts”, Mngxitama warned. No related posts.
