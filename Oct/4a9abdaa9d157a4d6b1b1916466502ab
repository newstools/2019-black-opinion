By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published on the Black First Land First website: Duduzane Zuma is a victim of a political vendetta by the Cyril Ramaphosa administration which is abusing state institutions like the Zondo Commission to settle political scores in service of white monopoly capital (WMC). The treatment that Duduzane Zuma has thus far received at the hands of the Ramaphosa administration clearly indicates that the prejudice he suffers is only because he is the son of President Jacob Zuma. Black First Land First (BLF) is of the view that none of the issues that Duduzane Zuma is expected to testify on at the Zondo Commission hearing tomorrow, will be addressed through a just evaluation of the evidence. The quasi judicial processes of the Zondo Commission are evidently driven by WMC interests. We note that the attacks on President Zuma and his son has attained new impetus after the May 2019 elections. BLF has long warned that a vote for Ramaphosa is a vote for the continuing attack on President Zuma and by extension his son. BLF demands that the Zondo Commission corrects its ways and gives Duduzane Zuma a fair hearing tomorrow. We stand with Duduzane Zuma, in the same way we stand with President Zuma â€“ all the way! BLF shall continue to defend black people who come under attack from land thieves and their institutions by any means necessary.
