On 28th October 2019, the Sunday World reported the following revelations made by Lerato Habiba Makgatho to it in an exclusive interview it had with her on Thursday, 24 October 2019: a. Gwede Mantashe and Finance Minister Tito Mboweni are involved in an intimate relationship with Makgatho. b. Makgatho‘s explicit sexual interactions with Mantashe can be gleaned from two different WhatsApp conversations, which Sunday World claims to have had sight of. c. In the first WhatsApp conversation, Makgatho speaks about “Mantashe’s sexual exploits” and Mantashe “also praises her for being a Kama Sutra in bed”. d. Makgatho described Mantashe as a “tiger” in bed and Mboweni as being a “control freak” who did not last as long as Mantashe in bed. Moreover Mantashe is married while Mboweni is not married. e. In the second WhatsApp conversation, Makgatho tells Mantashe “I want you”. He responds “what should I do. where you now”, to which she replies “ Baby please,” f. Mantashe then says, “My relationship with you has already costed [sic] me more than R70k” He states further, “I am afraid that this time it will cost me R100k.” g. In a WhatsApp conversation with Tito Mboweni, she ends the relationship with him because she is not happy any longer with him and intends to date other men. h. “Makgatho explained why she has decided to spill the beans now. She wanted the truth of her relationships with the two ministers to come out so that people can stop trying to extort money from the ministers”.

Upon being reached by Sunday World for comment on the said report before its publication, Mantashe has refused to respond to its questions. Mantashe instead admitted to paying two journalists an amount of R70,000 to stop the story about an alleged relationship between himself and Lerato Habiba Makgatho from being published. To this end Mantashe said: “Two journalists from your publication called me for the same story. So, you are the third person to call me for the same story, do you also want money? I paid them and now you are calling about the same story. Every time I asked them when they will publish the story, they told me the evidence is destroyed. “I begged them not to write the story, I paid two journalists at your publication. I will not reveal their names, you can ask amongst your colleagues and ask Lerato to tell you their names. You can go ahead and write the story, that is my comment”.

Makhudu Sefara, the editor of Sunday World, has declared that he is in possession of recordings of the conversation with Mantashe in which the minister admitted to paying two journalists with the amount of R70 000 to stop the relevant story from being published. (See YouTube, “Sunday World challenges Minister Gwede Mantashe to sue them”. Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1Jx2LHN60s) 8. Moferefere Lekorotsoana, the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy’s Chief of Staff, released a statement on behalf of the Mantashe in which he denied that the Minister had made the said admission. Lekorotsoana, has since altered his version. In a subsequent 702 Radio interview he said: “The minister’s version is that he didn’t pay any journalists to bury a story. The reality is that he may have made those claims but the actual fact is that he didn’t pay any journalist.” 9. Save for describing Mantashe’s prior admission as ‘unfortunate’, Lekorotsoana gave no reasonable explanation as to why Mantashe had bribed journalists if indeed he did not do so. 10. The Sunday World editor Sefara maintains that Mantashe did make the admission. He has declared that if this matter goes to court, he would reveal the evidence he has collated against Mantashe.

The South African Police Service (SAPS) must: a. ask Minister Gwede Mantashe to reveal the names of the journalists involved; b. Makhudu Sefara, as the editor of Sunday World, must be approached for the recordings of the conversation with Mantashe in which the minister admitted to paying the two journalists R70 000 to stop the relevant story from being published. c. investigate the conduct of Mantashe in relation to bribery, corruption and any other offence that his criminal actions may justify. 12. BLF calls for prompt action, further investigation and for this matter to be referred to the National Prosecution Authority (NPA) for the prosecution of Mantashe for bribery, corruption and any other offence that Mantashe’s criminality may justify.
