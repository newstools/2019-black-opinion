By Andile Mngxitama So VBS money was used to pay lobola and do the wedding of Floyd Shivambu? Uwumakoti weVBS. We can’t be silent when leaders steal from poor blacks to fund their dirty lifestyles. I just think that however difficult it can get, we must never sink to these lows. The poor work hard to form families. Their so called representatives however, just steal from the them to support their expensive lifestyles like hosting big wedding parties. It’s sad and evil! The tears of the poor elderly, who lost their savings at VBS, flow. If you do this to the poor, you will be regarded as an enemy of the revolution irrespective of how much “revolutionary” noise you make. It’s October, the month of Thomas Sankara – he who taught us not to steal from the people. The VBS looting shows us just how ideologically bankrupt the new layer of South African leadership is. Lets remember the Sankara Oath! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization. No related posts.
