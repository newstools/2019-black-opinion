To this end we acknowledge Alberto Fernandez’ overwhelming win of 48% of the votes against the 40.47% of the votes obtained by the U.S. backed Mauricio Macri. We wish Alberto Fernandez well in leading the country on a left course towards ending its economic crisis and reversing the neoliberal austerity measures initiated by Mauricio Macri. The victory is an indication of the hope that the Argentinian people have in Alberto Fernandez. We acknowledge that Alberto Fernández was the cabinet chief during the period of impressive economic growth during the 2000s. We also note the legacy of Cristina Fernández de Kirchner who, as the former president of Argentina, successfully led the country for two consecutive terms from 2007 to 2015. BLF wishes the Argentinian people under the leadership of Alberto Fernández success in building a new future free from neo liberalism and the stranglehold of U.S. imperialism. Viva President Alberto Fernández! Down with neoliberalism! Issued by the National Coordinating Committee of Black First Land First (BLF NCC)
