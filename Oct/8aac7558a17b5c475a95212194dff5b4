Photo credit: The Citizen By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published on the Black First Land First website: The raid by the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA), on the offices of the Sekunjalo Holdings that is chaired by Dr Iqbal Survé, is the most unfortunate development since 1994. There is little doubt that the apartheid regime like raid was a political attack on the independence of the media. It was moreover an intimidation tactic. It is clear that someone very high up in government doesn’t like the ground breaking investigative journalism that has been produced by Independent Media led by Survé. The nation knows now that the 2017 ANC elective conference was bought with an amount of R1 billion. The revelations in this regard are thanks to the Independent Media group owned by Senkunjalo Holdings. Black First Land First (BLF) asks: When is the FSCA raiding the offices of Steinhoff International? Also, why has the FSCA not raided the offices of Markus Jooste, whose proven corruption has caused the Public Investment Corporation (PIC) to lose over R20 billion? Is it because Jooste belongs to the cabal which has been exposed as funders of the CR17 campaign?
