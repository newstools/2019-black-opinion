Photo credit: IOL By BO Staff Writer Vatiswa Ndara, the lead actor of the popular television drama ‘iGazi’, sent a lengthy open letter to the Minister of Arts and Culture, Nathi Mthethwa, requesting that he takes decisive action against Ferguson Films for exploitation and the unfair working conditions that industry actors experience. More specifically Ndara has accused the Furgusons of underpaying her and other unfair labour practices. Ferguson Films is owned by Connie and Shona Ferguson. The Furgusons have indicated, through their lawyers, that they are considering taking legal action against Ndara. Moreover Phil Mphela, an entertainment commentator, has announced that the Fergusons find Ndara’s allegations to amount to misinformation and an attack on them. Andile Mngxitama, the President of the black consciousness organization Black First Land First (BLF), also raised the issue on social media this morning. “I’m not getting something here. So Vatiswa is dragging the Fergusons for daring to offer her R110 000 for a five weeks gig? I get the complaint about royalties for repeats but yirrrr kanti where are the trade unions and guilds? That’s an industry issue not Ferguson’s problem. I just don’t feel like the dragging of the Fergusons is justified. It feels like the general anti black attitude….”, Mngxitama said. No related posts.
