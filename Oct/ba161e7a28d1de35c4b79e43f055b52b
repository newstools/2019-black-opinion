By Andile Mngxitama Herman Mashaba is praised for resigning from a racist party that he joined knowing it’s racist? Worse still, he resigns from the DA because of the racism of Helen Zille. This is another level of stupidity. So when Zille praised colonialism, what did brother ‘Hairman’ think that was? Did he resign? When did he become so aggressively anti racist? After realizing they are coming for him? Ok, we aren’t all so gullible. Again, when was the DA ever not a racist party? Are people this stupid mara? This is tiring! Andile Mngxitama is the President of the black consciousness (BC) organization, Black First Land First. No related posts.
