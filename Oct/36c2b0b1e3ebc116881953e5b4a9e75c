Helen Zille’s announcement that she is contesting the position of chairperson of the party’s federal council. James Selfe formerly occupied this position for about twenty years. Andile Mngxitama, the President of the radical black consciousness (BC) organization, Black First Land First (BLF), gave his thoughts on the situation. He remarked: “BLF has been saying to the Zuma must go brigade, “when they (WMC) are finished with Zuma with your help, they will come for you. Juju and Mmusi won’t escape the chop. Whites are not your friends even if they give you Louis Vuitton and a wife…” A point not made in obiter, is that Tony Leon is the son of the ‘hanging judge’, Ramon Leon, who denied Solomon Mahlangu’s appeal of his death sentence. “Them whites are reclaiming their DA from house niggers. Stooges will fall. Just imagine Bantustan leaders challenging PW Botha their benefactor”, Mngxitama concluded on his reading of the situation. No related posts.
