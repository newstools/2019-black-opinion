By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published on the Black First Land First website: The Office of the Public Protector has received a clean audit from the auditor-general (AG) regarding its financial health and management. This shows that the Public Protector, Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane, is leading by example. All public institutions must emulate the high standards displayed by the Public Protector in the management of public finances. Black First Land First (BLF) calls upon both the executive and elected representatives, such as Members of Parliament (MPs), to follow the good practice and high ethical conduct of the Public Protectorâ€™s Office in matters related to financial management, internal controls, reporting, and record keeping. It is encouraging to hear that the AG has given the Public Protector a glowing review. Congratulations to the Public Protector for her solid management of public finances and servant leadership.
