By Andile Mngxitama The entire ‘Zuma Must Go’ brigade is corrupt. It was allowed by white monopoly capital (WMC) to loot in exchange for attacking Zuma. But WMC kept the receipts of the VBS lootists, Juju and Floyd, including houses and cars. It did the same in respect of Maimane’s benefits including a vehicle from Marcus Jooste and a house from Wessel Jacobs. WMC wants its stooges out. We run the real risk of being consumed in this reactionary battle. We must not be hoodwinked by the known racism of the handlers of these stooges – WMC. These stooges must account and repent. On our part, we must take the battle to the real enemy. I see that the Ramaphosa administration is run by Washington DC. I wonder how many CIA agents are running the South African government departments. The Americans are being brought openly into the country. Towards the end of last month, for instance, the United States Embassy in Pretoria hosted a number of South African Government Departments representatives to review and consolidate sectoral cooperation progress which obviously go against black interests. We need to develop a comprehensive response to the coming revelations. We must not get bogged down. Keep the eyes on the ball. Expose sellouts. Fight the real enemy! Black First!
