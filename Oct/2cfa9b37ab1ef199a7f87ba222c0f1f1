By Andile Mngxitama Can someone please explain what principle does Herman Mashaba stand on? Hereâ€™s a man who has served the racist anti black Democratic Alliance (DA) well. He is the only politician who has been openly xenophobic in defence of white monopoly capital (WMC). He expropriates public property and gives it to capital. He is open about being pro capitalist and a liberal. Mashaba is making a crude political calculation that he will come back in 2021 with his xenophobic party and be the kingmaker. He will go with whoever will make him mayor. He has been misled into believing that he has enough political exposure to enable him to get enough seats to be the kingmaker and to this end he will continue to run Joburg as a city of capital, not people. The chap believes he has enough support and can force his way back through the back door. He is about power, nothing more. Where is the principle here? Andile Mngxitama is the President of the black consciousness (BC) organization, Black First Land First. No related posts.
