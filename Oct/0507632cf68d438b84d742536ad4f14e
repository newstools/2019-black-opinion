We note that the failing Tunisian economy was a key factor that sparked the 2011 revolution and it was also the main factor of your election ticket. The election result indicating that about 90% of 18 to 25 year olds voted for you, is therefore testimony to the trust that the youth have in you, as the President of the country, to radically transform the economy towards the attainment of a truly equalitarian society. We wish the Tunisian people success in building a new Tunisia under your leadership.
Long live President Kaïs Saied! Long live the Tunisian people! Issued by the National Coordinating Committee of Black First Land First (BLF NCC)
