By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published on the Black First Land First website: The the minister of mineral resources and energy, Gwede Mantashe, has confessed to a crime. He is allegedly on record saying that he has bribed two journalists into not writing stories implicating him in acts of infidelity. The crime is not infidelity and tigritude in bed. The crime is the confessed bribery of journalists. In fact, Black First Land First BLF) doesn’t care what Mantashe does in his private life but confessing to crimes cannot go unchallenged. BLF shall do its part and open a criminal case against Minister Mantashe under the following details: Date: 31 October 2019 (Thursday)
Time: 11am
Venue: Hilbrow police station BLF is appalled by political parties such as the Democratic Alliance and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) who have sought to deflect attention from the fact that the conduct of Mantashe is nothing but pure criminality which in turn is a police matter. Appeals for Mantashe’s contrition and for parliamentary oversight of the matter serve to detract the public from the main issue. We call on the police to do its work.
