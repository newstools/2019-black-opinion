Only the president or the military can determine when the curfew should end. This was in terms of the President’s Decree 893. Consequently the military imposed a curfew of 24 hours preventing the movement of people in ‘’sensitive areas’ and ‘public spaces’, beginning from 3:00 p.m. on Saturday. Undeterred protesters continued with demonstrations. The military curfew has subsequently been lifted partially in certain parts of Quito pending the outcome of talks between President Lenín Moreno and the Ecuadorean Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities (Conaie). The United Nations Ecuador and the Ecuadorean Episcopal Conference will mediate these talks. In any event the protesters are preparing for potential clashes. Many have come from the Central University, Ecuador with material for barricades and fires. Six main roads, including the historic Simon Bolivar Avenue, have been shut down owing to the curfew . Moreover in the capital city Quito, which is central to the mobilizations, all the main roads have been closed. All modes of transportation have also been stopped. On Saturday, after the imposition of the curfew, there were reports that the safe spaces of the protesters such as the Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Ecuador (Pontifical Catholic University of Ecuador), and La Casa de la Cultura (the House of Culture) were attacked. In the meantime, Moreno had fled Quito during the protests to the city of Salinas where he announced a special session of the National Assembly would be held on 14 October. No related posts.
