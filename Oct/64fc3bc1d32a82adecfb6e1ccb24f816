By BO Staff Writer Supporters of ex president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva are mobilizing for action after a letter written by him, which was addressed to the Brazilian people, was released last month. “I am recommending to the PT and to the “O Povo Feliz de Novo” Coalition the replacement of my candidacy with that of my brother Fernando Haddad, who has thus far so loyally carried out the position of vice-presidential candidate … So, it is from my heart that I wish to ask all those who would vote for me to vote in my brother Fernando Haddad for President of the Republic”, Lula said in the letter Lula’s supporters are determined to get him out of prison. Plans to hold a protest march to Sao Paulo on 13 October, denouncing Lula’s imprisonment and demanding that he be released from jail, is being organized by civil society organizations and other progressive forces. Under the tenures of Lula and Dilma Rousseff, Brazil had come under attack from United States (US) led imperialism, especially for its pro-BRICS and pro-poor policies. This resulted in Rousseff being removed via a coup and replaced by the pro imperialist Michel Temer, and Lula being jailed to prevent him from contesting the presidential elections of 2018 as well as speaking to the media. Jair Bolsonaro won that elections. Lula has been imprisoned since April last year on bogus charges. There was heightened fury at Lula’s imprisonment following documents that were leaked involving the presiding judge in his  case.The leaked documents revealed serious violations of ethics and dubious collaboration between the senior prosecutor Deltan Dallagnol and Judge Sergio Moro who convicted Lula on corruption charges and sentenced him to imprisonment. Consequently Lula was barred from contesting the 2018 presidential elections. The leaked documents also revealed that there was serious doubt on the prosecution’s part regarding Lula’s guilt.
