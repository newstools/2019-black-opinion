By Andile Mngxitama Often when I’m asked, ungumni? Or in Setswana we would say o ana eng or in Sepedi o bina eng? Generally I say “ndingum-black” or my totem is BLACK. This is not a refusal of my roots but a political choice of my identity. I’m Black first, before I’m anything else. I’m linked to the global black experience, which is marked by slavery, colonialism and apartheid. Our blackness marks us out for oppression and death. We must use it for our salvation and liberation based on Black Solidarity (unity). We in South Africa must thank Steve Biko for helping us settle the question of tribalism. In many African countries, leadership is still chosen by tribe. We must never return to tribalism. We must resist tribalism. Black First!
