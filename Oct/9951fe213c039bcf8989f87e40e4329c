By Staff Writer In a shock move today Andile Mngxitama – the President Black First Land First (BLF) a radical, black consciousness and Pan Afrikanist organization – was banned from Facebook for 30 days. This follows Mngxitama’s sharing of a quote of W. E. B. Du Bois directly from a seminal book against racism and which explains the double consciousness of black people in America.  Mngxitama was explaining that black South Africans similarly suffer from the same condition described by Du Bois as double consciousness. This work of Du Bois “The Souls of Black Folk” was written in 1903. It is shocking that quoting Du Bois is seen as transgressing the rules of Facebook. This is a clear indication once more that Facebook is anti black and racist. Mark Zuckerberg must be told that there is no bigger activist against racism emanating from America than Du Bois. It is therefore highly ironic that quoting Du Bois can lead to such drastic actions under the pretext of fighting racism.  No related posts.
