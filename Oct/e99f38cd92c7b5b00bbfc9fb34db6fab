By Andile Mngxitama Informed political analysis will show that the unmasking of the Democratic Alliance (DA) as a party of white supremacy, is due to the revolutionary efforts of Black First Land First (BLF). Our movementâ€™s hard line position on the race question, forced the white electorate to abandon the wishy washy DA for the more unapologetically pro white Freedom Front Plus (FF+). The current unraveling of the DA is a function of white supremacy to try to regain the white vote lost to the FF+. The black vote and black leadership has become irrelevant to the DA. This is thanks to the position that BLF has forced into South African politics. BLF has exploded the myth that white political parties represent black interests. These parties can therefore no longer pretend to serve blacks. What must now happen is that black people must stop pretending that they are free and embrace black first! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization. No related posts.
